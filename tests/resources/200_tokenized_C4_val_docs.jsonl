In case you ever have a chance to visit our lovely state, and need a list of some fibery stops along the way -- this post is for you!\nFirst, we made a surprise stop in Astoria to Salon Boheme, where my wonderful husband had arranged for a haircut and manicure for me :) Here's the before and after for my new hairdo! I have nothing but good things to say about this particular salon -- if you ever get a chance to stop in and pamper yourself, I highly recommend it!\nWe then started our knitting journey along the Oregon coast, in the town of Seaside -- home of Creative Beginnings. This store specializes in yarn, as well as beads, and scrapbook supplies. They do have several aisles of yarns, along with many samples and garments to admire. Because they carry such a diverse assortment of crafting supplies, the salesperson may or may not be able to answer any yarn questions you might have.\nSeveral knitted items are also for sale in this store, along with pricing ideas in case you would rather knit your own. There is a cat that roams freely throughout the store, as well as a small indoor espresso stand. The aisles are large and easy to navigate, and there is plenty of inspiration if you are in the market for a new project!\nNext up is Coastal Yarns in the town of Cannon Beach. This little store is tucked away amidst the tourist shops lining the street. They do carry some local fiber, including Blue Moon Fiber arts, and they have a lovely selection of books and patterns with a cozy seating area. I have visited this store many times, and each time I have been pleasantly greeted by a very helpful clerk. This particular time, I chose a skein of Noro Silk Garden that exactly matched a luxurious project bag that I am sending to a friend of mine. In the back, there is a wall of luxury sock yarns that I love to browse through, as well as a fun selection of knitting notions and buttons.\nFinally, 10 miles down the coast from Cannon Beach is the town of Manzanita -- home to T-SPOT Yarn & Chocolates. I adore this store... from the darling way she has her yarns displayed against the back wall, to the wonderful selection of knitting samples and garments she has displayed throughout the store. This shop also carries gifts, embroidery designs, and gourmet chocolate (we decided to try the \"Bacon\" variety!) The owner is very knowledgeable, and pleasantly answered all of my questions.\nStay tuned for Part 2- where we venture into the wilds of Portland, OR to try out some new shops!", "timestamp": 1556009164000, "doc_text": "What to do with a week completely to ourselves.... with all the littles tucked away at Grandmas?

{"url": "https://coinfunda.com/angenium-ico-review/", "text": "The world ash and slag production can reach up to 739 million tons a year and in Russia, especially in the Moscow region alone, it is estimated that about only 6% of the natural resources that are mined reach the consumers and the rest are either stacked up in the storage places or fill up lands resulting in dumps and landfills. As a result of which, it can cause serious environmental issues like pollution, health issues of the people living nearby and also turning vacant lands into landfills causing a reduction of available lands for living. It is also estimated that in Russia and Africa, only 10 to 20% of these wastes are recycled whereas in countries like Japan, Germany and France about 60 to 100% of industrial wastes is recycled or used in construction. So, Russia is definitely lagging behind.\nMost of the waste recycling and incineration plants fail to recycle these waste products ecologically and only add up to the problem. Moreover, due to high cost of waste disposal, need of raw materials etc. most companies often prefer to the use of \u201csymbolic fines\u201d rather than dealing with the problem itself. The process of recycling waste is also quite expensive and not a profitable venture.\nAngenium is a unique project that will completely decompose man-made waste products into constituents of high cost. It\u2019s technology uses a unique sorbent that will work on all types of waste products and will extract precious metals like gold, silicon dioxide, aluminium dioxide, iron oxide and also pyrite cinders. The sorbent is 10 times cheaper than other analogues in the market. Even secondary resources like plastic, metal, radio electronic components are crushed and extracted to its full value. For e.g. from 1 ton of old mobile phones one can get 150 g of gold which is remarkable. The Blockchain based ecosystem will use tokens for all its transactions. Buyers will be provided with a certificate for purchase of products in the system and it will be recorded in the Blockchain network. The token used in the system is Angenium coin or ANG_Coin, which is ERC20 compliant and is based on the Ethereum Blockchain.\nA universal sorbent material that works on all metals and ensures 99.9% purity.\nIt can be operated anywhere from any country and has a capacity of 5000 to 1000000 tons of waste recycling per year.\nThe franchise is available everywhere on a \u201cready-to-operate\u201d basis.\nIt is in compliance with all the legal procedures and legislations and maintains all the standard ecological standards.\nIt is trademark protected and requires no approval for fourth or fifth grade non-toxic waste recycling, as the sorbent is organic.\nIt is ecologically balanced and does not affect the environment.\nIt will release tons of lands which were earlier filled with wastes.\nLow operational costs with wide range of final products from iron, gold to even rare earth metals.\nHigh market price for final products and the system will likely be adopted by many countries.\nIn Russia alone about 1.5 billion tons of ash and slag has covered about 28,000 hectares of land and about 50 million tons of pyrite wastes are generated from the Russian power plants. This is a major setback for the environment and economic landscape of the county resulting in health issues and reduction of available land for living.\nThe main aim of Angenium is to recycle these wastes at a very low cost, but produce final products of high cost that can also contribute to the economic growth of the nation. It will increase the volume and speed of mining process of precious metals where waste products will be the raw materials.

Around 5,000 registrations for the scheme are expected within the coming months, with those being tested needing to demonstrate competence in the areas of communication, product and technical knowledge, objection handling, complaints, and business processes if they are to gain the accreditation.\nIndustry bodies are keen to enforce new systems for ensuring both car mechanics and dealers reach a certain level of competence. This could mean that in the future, certification will be required - along with things like motor trade insurance - to allow garages and dealerships to operate legally.\nOnce tested, the IMI will list accredited car dealers on its public facing IMI Professional Register, with the traders being categorised as either a sales executive or senior sales executive. The higher level requires additional competence in the areas of workload management, warranty, coaching and supervision.\nIMI chief executive Steve Nash explained the reasoning behind the accreditation scheme: \"The role of the automotive sales professional in today\u2019s business has never been more challenging, with product, variant and option proliferation as well as ever tighter regulation of finance, so an accreditation route which addresses professional standards in this area is an important and logical step to take.\n\"We are certain this is the right course of action to raise standards in the sales arena and ensure good operators are rewarded and placed at the forefront of the industry.\"", "timestamp": 1555938156000, "doc_text": "The Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) has announced", "token_ids_start_true": [1270, 9679, 1267, 11699, 7726, 1264, 1006, 139501, 1007, 27233], "token_texts_start_true": ["\u2581The", "\u2581Institute\u2581of", "\u2581the", "\u2581Motor", "\u2581Industry", "\u2581", "(", "IMI", ")", "\u2581has\u2581announced"], "token_ids_start_false": [2349, 9679, 1267, 11699, 7726, 1264, 1006, 139501, 1007, 27233], "decoded_text_from_start_true": "The Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) has announced", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 3], [3, 16], [16, 20], [20, 26], [26, 35], [35, 36], [36, 37], [37, 40], [40, 41], [41, 55]]}

Chicago offers lots of options for corporate get-togethers. From outdoor concerts in the summer to cozy comedy shows in the winter, these classic Chicago after-hours outings make free time a fun time for your attendees, especially first-time visitors, to the Windy City.\nMillennium Park is Chicago\u2019s beautiful playground for the arts, situated right in the heart of the Loop, and is a great place for a corporate outing. Plan a dinner at Park Grill, located at the scenic gateway to Millennium Park. Reserve the private Founder\u2019s Room (seating 32), or arrange for semi-private dining accommodating 25+ guests. Seating is also available on Park Grill\u2019s outdoor patio, which is one of the largest in the city. Park Grill can provide a special menu of its contemporary American cuisine for your group.\nAfter dinner, make time to snap a group shot in front of the reflective Cloud Gate sculpture (affectionately called The Bean) and view the dazzling Crown Fountain, before making your way over to the Jay Pritzker Pavilion to catch a Grant Park Music Festival concert. The free Grant Park Music Festival has been a summer tradition in Chicago for more than 80 years, featuring classical music performed by world-class orchestras. Groups of 10 or more can arrange for reserved seating in the Seating Bowl; while groups of 50-100 can book the Choral Balcony (for select concerts), with an option of hosting a backstage reception before or after the show. The Grant Park Music Festival runs from mid-June through mid-August.\nArchitecture buffs will love the Chicago Architecture Foundation Center River Cruise Aboard Chicago\u2019s First Lady Cruises. Voted one of the top 10 tours in the U.S. by TripAdvisor, this popular 90-minute cruise is narrated by CAF-certified docents who point out more than 50 architectural gems along the Chicago River. As you pass by you\u2019ll hear about Chicago\u2019s fascinating history and the design giants who shaped the city\u2019s world-famous skyline.

Located right on the Chicago River along the scenic Chicago Riverwalk, at City Winery you can arrange for a semi-private reception for up to 200 guests in the breezy wine garden. Contact eventschicago@citywinery.com for more information.\nOr continue the architecture theme with a trek up to 360 CHICAGO, located on the 94th floor of 875 N Michigan (formerly the John Hancock Center). Named one of the Best Views in America by Travel + Leisure, the observation deck offers 360-degree views of the city, Lake Michigan and four states. And don\u2019t miss 360 CHICAGO\u2019s thrilling TILT, a huge steel-and-glass bay window that actually tilts forward, giving visitors a downward-facing view of the city from 1,000 feet up in the air. Afterwards, grab a cocktail in the Architect\u2019s Corner, 360 CHICAGO\u2019s bar and cafe. Group rates for 20 or more are available for 360 CHICAGO admission and Tilt tickets.\nNothing warms up a wintry Chicago night like a good belly laugh, and there\u2019s no better place to get your grin on than The Second City. This legendary comedy theater, known for its hilarious improv-based sketches, has produced stars that include Tina Fey, Bill Murray and Steve Carell. Start the evening with a pre-show dinner at the on-site 1959 Kitchen & Bar. This sleek restaurant has a laid-back neighborhood bar feel, with exposed brick and photos of Second City comedians hung on the walls. Group pre-theater dinner packages include selections from its menu of organic pub fare.\nThen it\u2019s on to the show. The Second City has been making audiences laugh for more than 50 years with hilarious sketches that include funny takes on current events, as well as a bit of song and dance. Shows take place seven nights a week, with various revues that feature up-and-coming performers who just might be the next big comedy stars of tomorrow. Make reservations for groups of 16 or more.\nSpring means one thing in Chicago: baseball. And there\u2019s no better place to experience America\u2019s favorite pastime than during a Chicago Cubs game at historic Wrigley Field. Before the game, join Wrigley Field Tours for a behind-the scenes look at the historic century-old ballpark, which include great photo opps on the field. Book a Private Tour for groups of 1-10 or 10-50 that comes with your own personal tour guide.\nThen get ready to watch the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs crack the bat in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field. For a VIP experience, reserve the Fannie May Bleacher Sweet. Located in center field with access to the legendary Budweiser Bleachers (a favorite seating spot for die-hard Cubs fans), the luxury temperature-controlled suite can accommodate 70-100 guests, and includes a food-and-beverage package of ballpark eats.

Upon completing his high school education, Christopher Cartwright majored in paramedics, emergency management, and nursing. Currently, Christopher Cartwright resides in Sydney with his spouse and two lovely children.\nThe Last Airship is the first installment in the Sam Reilly book series. This narrative has not only been well written but also brilliantly narrated as well. The Last Airship is a first moving narrative about power and wealth, blackmail, and greed, friendship and betrayal. The book begins during the early days of World War II, Magdalene, an exceptional art luxury airship, takes off quickly from Munich. On board, the state of the art ship were two exceedingly wealthy families, and a friend of the owner, who happens to be an academic professor. However, the state of the art airship was never seen again. Several years later, the airship was never found again. 75 years down the line, two climbers find a letter stamped with the family\u2019s official crest in the Alps. One of the climbers is one, Sam Riley, whom eventually finds himself in a life-threatening situation.\nThere were sections of the Last Airship that were dramatically atmospheric. Author Christopher Cartwright has not only written well but also clearly in suitable pace. The readers are definitely going to be fully invested in Christopher Cartwright\u2019s narrative from the first page to the very last. Cartwright can take the readers on a roller coaster ride.\nThe year is 1638, and one Albert Olsen, a worker of the Dutch Trading post, discovers the body of Orichalcum, as he was shoveling the sludge in the banks of one of the local rivers. Olsen immediately informs Hank Worthington, the lead engineer. Being an inquisitive person, Olsen decides to dive and beneath the bank, he discovers that there was a hidden city. However, Olsen boss does not take the revelation kindly and in the process brutally murders Olsen to ensure that the hidden city that he had discovered remains hidden forever. Author Christopher Cartwright then takes the readers to the present date, where we meet with Dr. Swan, who has just returned from Atlantis. Dr. Swan has evidence that doomsday was approaching rapidly. To ensure that she prevents the trigger, Dr. Swan has five weeks only.\nAs Dr. Swan looks for a trigger, she encounters a stalker and immediately asks Sam Reilly to assist her. However, before Sam could meet with Sam Riley, someone abducts her. After a little bit of digging, Sam Rilley discovers that the Phoenix Resistance was responsible for Dr. Swan\u2019s kidnapping. Before Dr. Swan was kidnapped another individual had taken her because she apparently knew how to reach the inner sanctum. However, Dr. Swan eventually realizes that she had not been abducted but rather saved by one, Edward Worthington from the Phoenix Resistance. Just like Dr. Swan, Edward was also conducting his research on the code.\nRogue Wave is undeniably one of the most imaginative narratives in the Sam Riley book series. In Rogue Wave, a team of scientists accidentally creates a monster during an experiment. The team of scientists is offered a cash reward of 20 billion dollars, to look into the recently discovered energy source that can be used to replace man\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel. However, it goes beyond saying, that the research that the team of scientists is handling is much more that the prize of 20 billion dollars. The suspense grows when danger threatens the underwater, from the air and in the water. The Bimini Road, a huge part of the Atlantis ultimately becomes the source, of huge waves, which have the capabilities of destroying the biggest supertankers. The Bimini Road has constantly been Sam\u2019s historical interest mainly because Sam Reilly has clues that the road was used by the ancient people in launching pirate attacks.\nWith that said, Rogue Waves is a fast-paced novel that is filled with numerous scientific points. The plot is quite interesting, and will keep the readers engaged throughout. As the fourth book in the Sam Riley book series, there is plenty of action, and as expected the good guys eventually won.\nThe Nostradamus Equation is a well-written adventure and treasure story that is much similar to the works of Clive Cluster. In Nostradamus Equation, author Christopher Cartwright introduces the readers to Dr. Zack, a descendant of one of the companions of Nostradamus, who is expected to fulfill a prophecy. After discovering the book, Clive decides to escape into the Sahara, with the aim of saving humanity. With that said, Nostradamus Equation is a novel for action and adventure lovers. All the characters in Nostradamus Equation have been brilliantly built. The storyline was not only full of action but also full of the character\u2019s deeds.\nThe Mahogany Ship is an intriguing narrative, that is full of edge of seat thrills and lots of actions. It is a continuation of the Lost Airship. In the Mahogany Ship, we meet once again with Sam Riley and her friends. The group is still looking for the Atlantis as well as a Chinese ship. Just as expected, The Mahogany Ship is filled with chases, danger and escapes since Sam and her team is not the only people who are hunting. In the year 1812, one of the biggest ships in the world, the Emily Rose was shipwrecked. The survivors had no option but to walk more than one thousand miles, to reach Sydney Cove, the only settlement.\nSeveral years later, a monstrous ship is found, a ship that was bigger than any ship that the British Army had ever built. By communicating with the natives, Sam and her group learn that Emily Rose had been there for more than a thousand years. With that said, the Mahogany Ship is a fast paced, page turning action-adventure narrative that is undeniably worth the readers time. The narrative is full of interesting heroes, handsome men, and beautiful women.", "timestamp": 1556093727000, "doc_text": "Christopher Cartwright is a writer known for penning spellbinding suspense and mystery novels.

Born in the year 1983, Christopher Cartwright has a background in the field of medicine where he served as a paramedic. Cartwright also served as a Scuba Diver and sailor. Upon completing his high school education, Christopher Cartwright majored in paramedics, emergency management, and nursing. Currently, Christopher Cartwright resides in Sydney with his spouse and two lovely children.\nThe Last Airship is the first installment in the Sam Reilly book series. This narrative has not only been well written but also brilliantly narrated as well. The Last Airship is a first moving narrative about power and wealth, blackmail, and greed, friendship and betrayal. The book begins during the early days of World War II, Magdalene, an exceptional art luxury airship, takes off quickly from Munich. On board, the state of the art ship were two exceedingly wealthy families, and a friend of the owner, who happens to be an academic professor. However, the state of the art airship was never seen again. Several years later, the airship was never found again. 75 years down the line, two climbers find a letter stamped with the family\u2019s official crest in the Alps. One of the climbers is one, Sam Riley, whom eventually finds himself in a life-threatening situation.\nThere were sections of the Last Airship that were dramatically atmospheric. Author Christopher Cartwright has not only written well but also clearly in suitable pace. The readers are definitely going to be fully invested in Christopher Cartwright\u2019s narrative from the first page to the very last. Cartwright can take the readers on a roller coaster ride.\nThe year is 1638, and one Albert Olsen, a worker of the Dutch Trading post, discovers the body of Orichalcum, as he was shoveling the sludge in the banks of one of the local rivers. Olsen immediately informs Hank Worthington, the lead engineer. Being an inquisitive person, Olsen decides to dive and beneath the bank, he discovers that there was a hidden city. However, Olsen boss does not take the revelation kindly and in the process brutally murders Olsen to ensure that the hidden city that he had discovered remains hidden forever. Author Christopher Cartwright then takes the readers to the present date, where we meet with Dr. Swan, who has just returned from Atlantis. Dr. Swan has evidence that doomsday was approaching rapidly. To ensure that she prevents the trigger, Dr. Swan has five weeks only.\nAs Dr. Swan looks for a trigger, she encounters a stalker and immediately asks Sam Reilly to assist her. However, before Sam could meet with Sam Riley, someone abducts her. After a little bit of digging, Sam Rilley discovers that the Phoenix Resistance was responsible for Dr. Swan\u2019s kidnapping. Before Dr. Swan was kidnapped another individual had taken her because she apparently knew how to reach the inner sanctum. However, Dr. Swan eventually realizes that she had not been abducted but rather saved by one, Edward Worthington from the Phoenix Resistance. Just like Dr. Swan, Edward was also conducting his research on the code.\nRogue Wave is undeniably one of the most imaginative narratives in the Sam Riley", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0,

At Arizona State, sophomore or junior students partner with the Arizon Republic. They enroll in a program for credit and are also paid for working with the paper two days a week.\nThe students get experience, and the paper gets new content. The students report mostly on breaking-news issues and the traffic generated by this new content accounts for about 10 percent of page views for the Republic, Brannon said.\nThere are other programs at other universities that serve as examples of successful partnerships between students and local publications. These relationships bridge the gap between student and professional journalists, proving there is a lot the two can learn from each other.\n\"There are fields where the academy leads the industry,\" panelist Rich Gordon, association professor at Medill School, Northwestern University, said.\nIn areas like medicine and science many breakthroughs occur in research labs on university campuses, outside of the professional sphere.\n\"It's time we apply the same line of thinking to journalism,\" Gordon said.", "timestamp": 1556056309000, "doc_text": "The fun thing about journalism is that it's a hands-on experience.

{"url": "https://www.spcforexcel.com/knowledge/variation/a-look-back-at-variation", "text": "This month\u2019s publication takes us back to a topic that started it all for our monthly publications back in January 2004 \u2013 variation. That article started out with my spilling milk when I was young. Back in those days, we didn\u2019t have those fancy plastic cups with lids on them. We just had glasses for children that were actually made of glass. No sippy cups. And whose fault was it when my milk spilled? My fault? Certainly not my mother\u2019s fault. Well, understanding variation may change how you look at whose \u201cfault\u201d it is.\nIn addition, this month we introduce how we have made it easier for you to navigate around our 13 years of publications in our SPC Knowledge Base. There are now over 150 articles on a variety of statistical topics \u2013 all free for you to access.\nYou may also download a pdf copy of this publication at this link. Please feel free to leave a comment at the end of the publication.\nThis is from our first publication back in January 2004 (with a few edits).\nI used to, now and then, spill a glass of milk when I was young. Our table slanted toward where my mother sat. So, the milk always headed in her direction. And she usually had some choice words when this happened. Of course, I was at fault. I needed to be more careful. Or was that really true? If you understand variation, you will realize that most of the problems you face are not due to individual people, but to the process -- the way it was designed and the way it is managed on a day-to-day basis.\nWhy is it important to know the type of variation present in your process? Because the action you take to improve your process depends on the type of variation present. If special causes are present, you must find the cause of the problem and then eliminate it from ever coming back, if possible. This is usually the responsibility of the person closest to the process.\nIf only common causes are present, you must FUNDAMENTALLY change the process. The key word is fundamentally -- a major change in the process is required to reduce common causes of variation. And management is responsible for changing the process.\nIt has been estimated that 94% of the problems a company faces are due to common causes. Only 6% are due to special causes (that may or may not be people related). So, if you always blame problems on people, you will be wrong at least 94% of the time. It is the process most of the time that needs to be changed. Management must set up the system to allow the processes to be changed.\nSo, Mom, sorry. But most of the time, spilling the milk was not my fault. It was usually yours (management). The glasses were too big for my small hands (no spill-proof cups in those days). When I wanted to put it by the edge of the table to make it easier to reach, you said move it back - I might spill it. And with the meal-time conversation, how could I concentrate on my milk!\nThe first thing to do in process improvement efforts is to teach the concept of variation. You need to know what is due to common causes of variation and what is due to special causes of variation.\nThat first publication back in 2004 also contained the following story. To really understand variation, many people have to change their paradigm. The following is a true story. A plant produced a number of different powdered products. Each of these products was run through the same production equipment at different conditions and put into unique silos (one or more for each product type).\nIt turns out that anyone who had worked in the unit for more than 3 months had time off for cross- contaminating a silo. If everyone is doing it, what type of variation is it? Common cause. And the only way to reduce common cause of variation is to change the process.\nSo how do you separate common from special causes of variation? The only effective way to do this is by using control charts.\nAre these sales numbers the same? The measurements we take reflect the variation in the process. The problem with measurement systems that compare one-time frame to another is that the actual performance (variation) of the process is hidden - we don't know what the underlying process is doing.\nThe monthly sales report is a good example. It compares this month\u2019s sales to last month\u2019s sales. Or maybe to the same month for the previous year. What nonsense. What does this tell you? Well \u2013 it tells me if things are better or worse. Does it? Well, I feel better when the sales number is higher. Really? What usually happens after a record sales month? The next month is often lower. You have to understand variation. The assumption that there is one reason why sales are higher this month than last month\u2019s is not valid.\nThe only tool to effectively examine the behavior of a process is a control chart. The data in Table 1 is our sales data. What does this table of data show you?\nThe table does begin to show some of the variation in the underlying process. It is an improvement over the limited comparison of two numbers. But it is still difficult to see the underlying process behavior.\nTo really understand what is happening, you need to construct a control chart. The individuals control chart for the data in Table 1 is shown in the figure below. We will not show the moving range chart here.\nThe upper control limit (UCL) is the largest value you would expect from a process with just common causes of variation present. The lower control limit (LCL) is the smallest value you would expect. As long as the all the points are within the limits and there are no patterns, only common cause of variation are present. The process is said to be \"in control\" To improve it, you must fundamentally change the process.\nAll the points are within the control limits and there are no patterns. The sales process is \"in control.\" Sales might be as low as 3,899 or as high as 14,222 each month. The variation is simply the random variation in the process. We can predict what will happen in the future. As long as the process remains the same, sales will average 9060 per month with the monthly variation being between the control limits.\nQuite often, people will say that the control limits are too wide - and don't really help them. They miss the point. It is not the control limits, but the story that the control chart tells. It provides feedback on the state of the process - improving or declining or in control. And this process is in statistical control, it tells leadership that the process must be fundamentally changed if sales are to increase. The key word here is fundamentally. This means new products, new sales approaches, etc. And the control chart can be used to judge the impact of those fundamental changes.\nSuppose you click on the first article listed. This takes you to the article on variation from January 2004. When you are on the publication page, look at the right-hand column. You will see a list of all the publications in that category. The one you are viewing is listed in black; the others are in blue. This allows you to move to other publications within the category.\nHopefully, this makes it easier to navigate through all the publications to find the ones that interest you!\nWe appreciate you taking time to read our publications. It has been a joy to provide them to you over the years \u2013 our gift for those seeking to understand. Best wishes to you and yours in the New Year!\nDoes the interpretation of XmR range chart, like the other variable control (Shewart\u00b4s) charts is reliable only if data follow a Normal Distribution? How can we check it?\nIt is not a requirement that data be normally distributed to use a control chart. Points beyond the control limits work pretty well regardless of the type of distribution. The zones tests may give some false signals if the distribution is very skewed, as discussed in the article on Control Chart and Non-Normal Data. As far as determining if data are normally distributed, please see our June 2016 artice: What? My Data are Not Normal?", "timestamp": 1556113928000, "doc_text": "This month\u2019s publication takes us back to a topic that started it all for our monthly publications back in January 2004 \u2013 variation.

"This month\u2019s publication takes us back to a topic that started it all for our monthly publications back in January 2004 \u2013 variation. That article started out with my spilling milk when I was young. Back in those days, we didn\u2019t have those fancy plastic cups with lids on them. We just had glasses for children that were actually made of glass. No sippy cups. And whose fault was it when my milk spilled? My fault? Certainly not my mother\u2019s fault. Well, understanding variation may change how you look at whose \u201cfault\u201d it is.\nIn addition, this month we introduce how we have made it easier for you to navigate around our 13 years of publications in our SPC Knowledge Base. There are now over 150 articles on a variety of statistical topics \u2013 all free for you to access.\nYou may also download a pdf copy of this publication at this link. Please feel free to leave a comment at the end of the publication.\nThis is from our first publication back in January 2004 (with a few edits).\nI used to, now and then, spill a glass of milk when I was young. Our table slanted toward where my mother sat. So, the milk always headed in her direction. And she usually had some choice words when this happened. Of course, I was at fault. I needed to be more careful. Or was that really true? If you understand variation, you will realize that most of the problems you face are not due to individual people, but to the process -- the way it was designed and the way it is managed on a day-to-day basis.\nWhy is it important to know the type of variation present in your process? Because the action you take to improve your process depends on the type of variation present. If special causes are present, you must find the cause of the problem and then eliminate it from ever coming back, if possible. This is usually the responsibility of the person closest to the process.\nIf only common causes are present, you must FUNDAMENTALLY change the process. The key word is fundamentally -- a major change in the process is required to reduce common causes of variation. And management is responsible for changing the process.\nIt has been estimated that 94% of the problems a company faces are due to common causes. Only 6% are due to special causes (that may or may not be people related). So, if you always blame problems on people, you will be wrong at least 94% of the time. It is the process most of the time that needs to be changed. Management must set up the system to allow the processes to be changed.\nSo, Mom, sorry. But most of the time, spilling the milk was not my fault. It was usually yours (management). The glasses were too big for my small hands (no spill-proof cups in those days). When I wanted to put it by the edge of the table to make it easier to reach, you said move it back - I might spill it. And with the meal-time conversation, how could I concentrate on my milk!\nThe first thing to do in process improvement efforts is to teach the concept of variation. You need to know what is due to common causes of variation and what is due to special causes of variation.\nThat first publication back in 2004 also contained the following story. To really understand variation, many people have to change their paradigm. The following is a true story. A plant produced a number of different powdered products. Each of these products was run through the same production equipment at different conditions and put into unique silos (one or more for each product type).\nIt turns out that anyone who had worked in the unit for more than 3 months had time off for cross- contaminating a silo. If everyone is doing it, what type of variation is it? Common cause. And the only way to reduce common cause of variation is to change the process.\nSo how do you separate common from special causes of variation? The only effective way to do this is by using control charts.\nAre these sales numbers the same? The measurements we take reflect the variation in the process. The problem with measurement systems that compare one-time frame to another is that the actual performance (variation) of the process is hidden - we don't know what the underlying process is doing.\nThe monthly sales report is a good example. It compares this month\u2019s sales to last month\u2019s sales. Or maybe to the same month for the previous year. What nonsense. What does this tell you? Well \u2013 it tells me if things are better or worse. Does it? Well, I feel better when the sales number is higher. Really? What usually happens after a record sales month? The next month is often lower. You have to understand variation. The assumption that there is one reason why sales are higher this month than last month\u2019s is not valid.\nThe only tool to effectively examine the behavior of a process is a control chart. The data in Table 1 is our sales data. What does this table of data show you?\nThe table does begin to show some of the variation in the underlying process. It is an improvement over the limited comparison of two numbers. But it is still difficult to see the underlying process behavior.\nTo really understand what is happening, you need to construct a control chart. The individuals control chart for the data in Table 1 is shown in the figure below. We will not show the moving range chart here.\nThe upper control limit (UCL) is the largest value you would expect from a process with just common causes of variation present. The lower control limit (LCL) is the smallest value you would expect. As long as the all the points are within the limits and there are no patterns, only common cause of variation are present. The process is said to be \"in control\" To improve it, you must fundamentally change the process.\nAll the points are within the control limits and there are no patterns. The sales process is \"in control.\" Sales might be as low as 3,899 or as high as 14,222 each month. The variation is simply the random variation in the process. We can predict what will happen in the future. As long as the process remains the same, sales will average 9060 per month with the monthly variation being between the control limits.\nQuite often, people will say that the control limits are too wide - and don't really help them. They miss the point. It is not the control limits, but the story that the control chart tells. It provides feedback on the state of the process - improving or declining or in control. And this process is in statistical control, it tells leadership that the process must be fundamentally changed if sales are to increase. The key word here is fundamentally. This means new products, new sales approaches, etc. And the control chart can be used to judge the impact of those fundamental changes.\nSuppose you click on the first article listed. This takes you to the article on variation from January 2004. When you are on the publication page, look at the right-hand column. You will see a list of all the publications in that category. The one you are viewing is listed in black; the others are in blue. This allows you to move to other publications within the category.\nHopefully, this makes it easier to navigate through all the publications to find the ones that interest you!\nWe appreciate you taking time to read our publications.

Glory, the Sky Blues couldn't hold on conceding twice in the last seven minutes to lose 2-1 at Allianz Stadium.\nIt's been a tough few weeks for Sydney, losing both Corey Gameiro and Ali Abbas to season-ending knee injuries, while they were also without marquee man Mark Janko and defender Sasa Ognenovski against Perth.\nWith Abbas and Gameiro on the long-term injury list, the Sky Blues are scouring the globe for a couple of injury-replacement deals as Arnold looks to add better balance to his side.\n\"We've contacted our network of overseas agents to see what's available,\" the Sky Blues boss said.\n\"We've only got three foreigners here at the moment and we do have an area of positions to be able to use another two foreigners.\n\"We're getting emails every day, we're looking at them and doing our due diligence to make sure they are the right foreigners.\n\"The squad could be better balanced but it's not at this moment. We have to move forward this month and in January we can get two injury replacements for the two we've lost. We just keep battling away.\"\nSydney certainly had to battle in the first half against Perth, on the back foot for much of the opening 45 minutes.\nBut as has been the case for most of the season they lifted after the break and took the lead through a controversial penalty after referee Alan Milliner adjudged Glory's Dino Djulbic to have handled in the box.\nThey then squandered a couple of other chances to double the lead, before the Glory hit back through Rostyn Griffiths and an Andy Keogh penalty late on.\n\"We need to be ruthless and need to punish teams,\" Arnold said.\n\"We had them by the throat at 1-0 and could have strangled them but we let them off. We've probably ridden our luck over the last few weeks where we got away with some results but tonight it turned the other way.\"\nArnold was reluctant to talk about the penalty awarded to Perth three minutes", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 7], [7, 19], [19, 27], [27, 33], [33, 39], [39, 40], [40, 44], [44, 48], [48, 54], [54, 63], [63, 71], [71, 81], [81, 87], [87, 99], [99, 113], [113, 121], [121, 122], [122, 123], [123, 124], [124, 125], [125, 128], [128, 136], [136, 144], [144, 145], [145, 146], [146, 155], [155, 163], [163, 173], [173, 177], [177, 184], [184, 185], [185, 192], [192, 197], [197, 203], [203, 208], [208, 211], [211, 215], [215, 219], [219, 225], [225, 228], [228, 242], [242, 247], [247, 256], [256, 257], [257, 273], [273, 278], [278, 286], [286, 294], [294, 298], [298, 303], [303, 307], [307, 309], [309, 313], [313, 322], [322, 327], [327, 330], [330, 333], [333, 338], [338, 346], [346, 352], [352, 353], [353, 354], [354, 358], [358, 364], [364, 368], [368, 373], [373, 376], [376, 383], [383, 393], [393, 400], [400, 405], [405, 406], [406, 410], [410, 414], [414, 419], [419, 424], [424, 433], [433, 443], [443, 459], [459, 466], [466, 467], [467, 478], [478, 484], [484, 487], [487, 494], [494, 500], [500, 507], [507, 514], [514, 522], [522, 525], [525, 534], [534, 535], [535, 536], [536, 537], [537, 542], [542, 552], [552, 556], [556, 567], [567, 576], [576, 583], [583, 595], [595, 597], [597, 607], [607, 608], [608, 609], [609, 613], [613, 617], [617, 623], [623, 628], [628, 633], [633, 634], [634, 635], [635, 636], [636, 641], [641, 650], [650, 656], [656, 667], [667, 672], [672, 686], [686, 690], [690, 701], [701, 712], [712, 722], [722, 740], [740, 748], [748, 752], [752, 763], [763, 764], [764, 765], [765, 766], [766, 771], [771, 779], [779, 786], [786, 796], [796, 797], [797, 814], [814, 819], [819, 829], [829, 833], [833, 847], [847, 869], [869, 879], [879, 890], [890, 891], [891, 892], [892, 893], [893, 896], [896, 902], [902, 918], [918, 927], [927, 940], [940, 955], [955, 956], [956, 964], [964, 980], [980, 991], [991, 995], [995, 998], [998, 999], [999, 1006], [1006, 1017], [1017, 1021], [1021, 1028], [1028, 1045], [1045, 1053], [1053, 1059], [1059, 1064], [1064, 1065], [1065, 1068], [1068, 1078], [1078, 1087], [1087, 1092], [1092, 1094], [1094, 1095], [1095, 1101], [1101, 1111], [1111, 1115], [1115, 1125], [1125, 1143], [1143, 1151], [1151, 1157], [1157, 1158], [1158, 1170], [1170, 1175], [1175, 1191], [1191, 1199], [1199, 1200], [1200, 1202], [1202, 1210], [1210, 1211], [1211, 1212], [1212, 1218], [1218, 1227], [1227, 1240], [1240, 1252], [1252, 1259], [1259, 1264], [1264, 1271], [1271, 1287], [1287, 1291], [1291, 1305], [1305, 1313], [1313, 1329], [1329, 1337], [1337, 1343], [1343, 1351], [1351, 1356], [1356, 1361], [1361, 1365], [1365, 1374], [1374, 1380], [1380, 1382], [1382, 1387], [1387, 1389], [1389, 1392], [1392, 1395], [1395, 1403], [1403, 1411], [1411, 1422], [1422, 1423], [1423, 1424], [1424, 1433], [1433, 1444], [1444, 1462], [1462, 1470], [1470, 1480], [1480, 1489], [1489, 1490], [1490, 1501], [1501, 1507], [1507, 1516], [1516, 1524], [1524, 1528], [1528, 1531], [1531, 1541], [1541, 1548], [1548, 1553], [1553, 1559], [1559, 1567], [1567, 1572], [1572, 1575], [1575, 1576], [1576, 1577], [1577, 1578], [1578, 1580], [1580, 1591], [1591, 1600], [1600, 1609], [1609, 1619], [1619, 1625], [1625, 1626], [1626, 1627], [1627, 1634], [1634, 1639], [1639, 1640], [1640, 1641], [1641, 1642], [1642, 1644], [1644, 1648], [1648, 1656], [1656, 1667], [1667, 1670], [1670, 1671], [1671, 1672], [1672, 1673], [1673, 1674], [1674, 1678], [1678, 1689], [1689, 1699], [1699, 1704], [1704, 1711], [1711, 1720], [1720, 1724], [1724, 1725], [1725, 1731], [1731, 1740], [1740, 1747], [1747, 1751], [1751, 1756], [1756, 1780], [1780, 1789], [1789, 1803], [1803, 1808], [1808, 1816], [1816, 1820], [1820, 1828], [1828, 1831], [1831, 1838], [1838, 1852], [1852, 1854], [1854, 1855], [1855, 1861], [1861, 1865], [1865, 1878], [1878, 1889], [1889, 1901], [1901, 1912], [1912, 1918], [1918, 1932]]}
{"url": "http://cinemasentries.com/review/the-princess-bride-30th-anniversary-fathom-events-review-a-fun-experience/", "text": "A welcome return to the big screen after all these years.\nThirty years ago, director Rob Reiner brought to the silver screen a film based on the 1973 novel written by William Goldman. Not only was Reiner a huge fan of the author but felt this novel was the best thing he had written and did everything he could to turn it into a movie. While the screenplay was being kicked around Hollywood by different people, Reiner managed to snag it after he had a one-on-one with the author and received backing from Norman Lear.\nKeeping to the original idea of having the film feel more like a novel, the story begins with the Grandson (Fred Savage) home sick in bed. The Grandfather (Peter Falk) comes to check in on him trying to lift his spirits. To do this, he chooses to read him a story. But what young boy wants to hear a book read to him when he could be playing video games? With some reverse psychology and a little bit of convincing, the Grandfather manages to tell him one of the greatest love stories of all time.\nThe tale begins with the farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes) who falls for the fair maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright). Eventually, he manages to win her over and the two dream of the future together. But a farm boy needs to make a living so he sets off on the high seas to make his fortune. The high seas are a dangerous place for a man and his ship is sunk by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nFive years pass and the heartbroken maiden, who lost her one true love catches the eye of Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon), who convinces her to marry him. Before they can be married, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of mercenaries. The group is led by the brains, Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two henchmen, Fezzik (Andre The Giant) who is the muscle of the group, and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the skilled Spanish swordsman. Vizzini plans to kill the future princess near the border of Florin and Guilder to start a war between the two nations. As the abductors near the Cliffs of Insanity, they find that they are being followed by a lone man all dressed in black. Is he there to rescue her? Is he there to kidnap Buttercup for himself? What exactly are his intentions and most importantly, who is he?\nBy now we should all know the answers to those questions. While the film was not a huge box-office phenomenon during its initial release, it has become a classic and a favorite of millions. Not only does it have swashbuckler action, and the ultimate love story, but it is one of the funniest films of all time.\nThat being said, there\u2019s no reason to critique the movie at this point. What\u2019s left to discuss is how the overall Fathom presentation turned out. In the theatre I attended, there were approximately 80 people there. The crowd was a good selection of age ranges, with a lot of older parents bringing in their adult children. Most of the audience were fans and happy to finally see the film in a theatre. I have to admit that even for myself that was enough to make me happy. But as with other Fathom events, there were some extras. Thirty minutes before the film began, there was the traditional trivia questions posted on the screen, such as Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits wrote the soundtrack; Billy Crystal adlibbed most of his lines; and Courtney Cox, Sean Young, Carrie Fischer, Meg Ryan, and Uma Thurman were all considered for the role of Buttercup. Shortly before the film started and after it ended, there were brief interviews with director Rob Reiner who discussed the filmmaking process, how they went about gathering the cast, and humorous on-set anecdotes.\nI\u2019ve been to several Fathom events and it did not quite live up to the standards I\u2019ve come to expect. The number of trivia questions before the film started were only a handful and the rest of the time was filled with a barrage of commercials, some of them looked like they were having trouble buffering correctly and looked choppy and unfocused. The interview also felt lacking as the only person involved was Reiner even though the interviewer mentioned talking to the rest of the cast about various topics. It would have been nice to have some more interviews or at least some explanation as to why the rest of the cast wasn\u2019t there. Even with these small deficiencies, it was a fun experience to see something I have only watched on television on a big screen and well worth the time and effort.", "timestamp": 1555885438000, "doc_text": "A welcome return to the big screen after all these years.\nThirty years ago, director Rob Reiner brought to the silver screen a film based on the 1973 novel written by William Goldman. Not only was Reiner a huge fan of the author but felt this novel was the best thing he had written and did everything he could to turn it into a movie. While the screenplay was being kicked around Hollywood by different people, Reiner managed to snag it after he had a one-on-one with the author and received backing from Norman Lear.\nKeeping to the original idea of having the film feel more like a novel, the story begins with the Grandson (Fred Savage) home sick in bed. The Grandfather (Peter Falk) comes to check in on him trying to lift his spirits. To do this, he chooses to read him a story. But what young boy wants to hear a book read to him when he could be playing video games? With some reverse psychology and a little bit of convincing, the Grandfather manages to tell him one of the greatest love stories of all time.\nThe tale begins with the farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes) who falls for the fair maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright). Eventually, he manages to win her over and the two dream of the future together. But a farm boy needs to make a living so he sets off on the high seas to make his fortune. The high seas are a dangerous place for a man and his ship is sunk by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nFive years pass and the heartbroken maiden, who lost her one true love catches the eye of Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon), who convinces her to marry him. Before they can be married, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of mercenaries. The group is led by the brains, Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two henchmen, Fezzik (Andre The Giant) who is the muscle of the group, and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the skilled Spanish swordsman. Vizzini plans to kill the future princess near the border of Florin and Guilder to start a war between the two nations. As the abductors near the Cliffs of Insanity, they find that they are being followed by a lone man all dressed in black. Is he there to rescue her? Is he there to kidnap Buttercup for himself? What exactly are his intentions and most importantly, who is he?\nBy now we should all know the answers to those questions. While the film was not a huge box-office phenomenon during its initial release, it has become a classic and a favorite of millions. Not only does it have swashbuckler action, and the ultimate love story, but it is one of the funniest films of all time.\nThat being said, there\u2019s no reason to critique the movie at this point. What\u2019s left to discuss is how the overall Fathom presentation turned out. In the theatre I attended, there were approximately 80 people there. The crowd was a good selection of age ranges, with a lot of older parents bringing in their adult children. Most of the audience were fans and happy to finally see the film in a theatre. I have to admit that even for myself that was enough to make me happy. But as with other Fathom events, there were some extras. Thirty minutes before the film began, there was the traditional trivia questions posted on the screen, such as Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits wrote the soundtrack; Billy Crystal adlibbed most of his lines; and Courtney Cox, Sean Young, Carrie Fischer, Meg Ryan, and Uma Thurman were all considered for the role of Buttercup.

"decoded_text_from_start_true": "A welcome return to the big screen after all these years.\nThirty years ago, director Rob Reiner brought to the silver screen a film based on the 1973 novel written by William Goldman. Not only was Reiner a huge fan of the author but felt this novel was the best thing he had written and did everything he could to turn it into a movie. While the screenplay was being kicked around Hollywood by different people, Reiner managed to snag it after he had a one-on-one with the author and received backing from Norman Lear.\nKeeping to the original idea of having the film feel more like a novel, the story begins with the Grandson (Fred Savage) home sick in bed. The Grandfather (Peter Falk) comes to check in on him trying to lift his spirits. To do this, he chooses to read him a story. But what young boy wants to hear a book read to him when he could be playing video games? With some reverse psychology and a little bit of convincing, the Grandfather manages to tell him one of the greatest love stories of all time.\nThe tale begins with the farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes) who falls for the fair maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright). Eventually, he manages to win her over and the two dream of the future together. But a farm boy needs to make a living so he sets off on the high seas to make his fortune. The high seas are a dangerous place for a man and his ship is sunk by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nFive years pass and the heartbroken maiden, who lost her one true love catches the eye of Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon), who convinces her to marry him. Before they can be married, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of mercenaries. The group is led by the brains, Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two henchmen, Fezzik (Andre The Giant) who is the muscle of the group, and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the skilled Spanish swordsman. Vizzini plans to kill the future princess near the border of Florin and Guilder to start a war between the two nations. As the abductors near the Cliffs of Insanity, they find that they are being followed by a lone man all dressed in black. Is he there to rescue her? Is he there to kidnap Buttercup for himself? What exactly are his intentions and most importantly, who is he?\nBy now we should all know the answers to those questions. While the film was not a huge box-office phenomenon during its initial release, it has become a classic and a favorite of millions. Not only does it have swashbuckler action, and the ultimate love story, but it is one of the funniest films of all time.\nThat being said, there\u2019s no reason to critique the movie at this point. What\u2019s left to discuss is how the overall Fathom presentation turned out. In the theatre I attended, there were approximately 80 people there. The crowd was a good selection of age ranges, with a lot of older parents bringing in their adult children. Most of the audience were fans and happy to finally see the film in a theatre. I have to admit that even for myself that was enough to make me happy. But as with other Fathom events, there were some extras. Thirty minutes before the film began, there was the traditional trivia questions posted on the screen, such as Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits wrote the soundtrack; Billy Crystal adlibbed most of his lines; and Courtney Cox, Sean Young, Carrie Fischer, Meg Ryan, and Uma Thurman were all considered for the role of Buttercup. Shortly before the film started and after it ended, there were brief interviews with director Rob Reiner who discussed the filmmaking process, how they went about gathering the cast, and humorous on-set anecdotes.\nI\u2019ve been to several Fathom events and it did not quite live up to the standards I\u2019ve come to expect. The number of trivia questions before the film started were only a handful and the rest of the time was filled with a barrage of commercials, some of them looked like they were having trouble buffering correctly and looked choppy and unfocused.

{"url": "http://careers-mondelezinternational.cms.mdlzapps.com/our-stories/fearless-marketing-wholesome", "text": "Katrina Plummer started life at Mondel\u0113z International as an MBA Intern back in the summer of 2012 before joining us full time in August 2013. She brought with her experience working with companies such as Estee Launder and Burberry, and has since worked with a range of our brands, including Halls, Swedish Fish, Teddy and, most recently, Honey Maid.\nBefore joining MDLZ, my experience was in premium skincare and cosmetics. I worked on the global communications teams for Clinique at the Estee Launder Companies in NYC. My responsibilities included press outreach and new product launch planning. I also held a PR internship with Burberry in London, and an advertising internship with Deutsch in LA.\nEvery time I change brands or business, I feel challenged. It is so much easier when you have the time and expertise with the brand you are working with but with each new challenge, my learning agility grows hugely! I remind myself to embrace the fresh eyes and fresh thinking of a new role and take advantage of developing skills in new markets and consumers.\nSince joining MDLZ, I have had the pleasure of working on a number of brands over the past 3 years. To start with, I was the Associate Brand Manager for Halls Cough Drops US, where I learnt business fundamentals, lead monthly budgeting, sales and inventory tracking, forecasting, supporting the social media campaign, and commercialized flavour line extensions.\nI then became Senior Associate Brand Manager for Candy & Cough in North America, where I was able to lead business decision making based on my analysis of category and consumer trends. During this time, I re-launched the Swedish Fish brand to target a new consumer demographic and recommended a strategy for how best to compete in the category.\nMost recently, I became Equity Brand Manager for our Kids Biscuit business in North America where my portfolio includes Honey Maid, Teddy and Multi-Packs. In this role I get to set the strategy for the business based on external trends and capabilities to drive our sales growth based on a certain level of marketing spend. This will inform the new products and advertising that you will start seeing in market very soon.\nI experience such a high every time I see something I have worked on in the market. It can take years for something to go from ideation to implementation and often it reaches market when I am no longer working on that brand. I find it hard to fast forward through commercials and I cannot go the food store without walking own all of the aisles because I love seeing the finished product of the work I supported!\nIn 2014, Honey Maid launched the groundbreaking \"This is Wholesome\" campaign, rooted in the idea that while the makeup and day-to-day lives of families have evolved \u2013 just like Honey Maid products \u2013 the importance of wholesome family connections remains the same. Since launch, we've received accolades internally and externally for boldly showcasing the diversity of American families.\nWe feature five real American families: an adopted son, a disabled veteran, a Hispanic gay couple and neighbors of different cultures. And we tell their stories while inviting viewers to think about acceptance in their own lives. Each video culminates with the creation of a wholesome Honey Maid snack, showing how snacking moments can bring families together. Our integrated marketing campaign includes TV, a dedicated digital and social media program, and media collaborations with the PR team. The creation of this campaign has been a relay race, with lots of baton passing, and with teamwork and trust that took us over the finish line!\nThree years ago, colleagues of mine created the concept for the campaign. When I had the privilege of taking over, my role was to finalize the creative, gather alignment and approvals, and work closely with my Media & Content counterpart to get the videos (the \u201cspots\u201d) up and support via our agency partners.\nWe created this campaign during a time of great change for our Marketing team and our media partners. It required attention to detail, and strong communication to ensure we had continuity and everyone was aligned. There was a lot of learning while doing! As we got ready to launch, our team put an outreach plan in place to consumers and media, mindful of the external environment and how our message would come across. Together we accepted the risk that comes with a fearless marketing campaign like this \u2026 and we prepared for many different responses! Fortunately, the public response has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\"This is Wholesome\" makes me proud on so many levels. I'm proud to work for a company and on a brand that spreads messaging of positivity and inclusion. And I'm proud that I was on a team that could rally together in times of change to deliver great work. But what brings me the most pride is hearing the reactions to the campaign from colleagues. We wouldn't have a \"This is Wholesome\" campaign if it were not for the courage and support of so many people. From RD&Q to Sales to our in-store team \u2013 we're all working together to create and deliver great products that give us a reason to tell great stories. I know firsthand our advertising instills pride in those who work on Honey Maid and at MDLZ. And I'm so proud to be part of an organization that gives me the opportunity to make campaigns like this a reality.\nHoney Maid recently released the latest chapter in the \u201cThis Is Wholesome\u201d campaign, which underscores the importance of acceptance in a changing American culture. The brand is celebrating four different stories of acceptance featuring five families, including a traditional Hispanic father who found joy and love in accepting his gay son and son-in-law, a disabled veteran and wife that have come to accept their new post-war reality, a young boy who has accepted his adopted brother, and two neighboring families who have grown to realize they have more similarities than differences.

Had bit of a chat with him, said his granddad once gave John's parents a loan and to say thanks, they gave him 30 pieces of his artwork!\nI tried for a while to get him to sell me three lovely Nemesis pages but he was convinced ebay was the way to go. Someone had him convinced the lot was worth 30-40k. Haven't seen them pop up after those recent Dredd pages he had listed unfortunately.\nMust get in contact with him again to see if he's changed his mind.

Over the weekend, former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich called for opposition to Fast Track and the TPP. The failure of Obama's past SOTU trade promises is feeding skepticism. In his 2011 SOTU, Obama promised the pact would expand U.S. exports to Korea. In the pact's first year, exports dropped 10 percent, imports soared and the U.S. trade deficit with Korea grew 37 percent, equating to a net loss of approximately 40,000 more U.S. jobs.\nDemocratic and GOP presidents have struggled to persuade Congress to provide Fast Track authority, which Congress has authorized for only five years (2002-07) of the past 20. In late 2013, 151 House Democrats signed a letter opposing Fast Track. Two weeks ago, when U.S. Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and U.S. Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced legislation to establish Fast Track, 17 Senate Democrats sentletters opposing the bill, which did not have a single House Democratic sponsor.

Implementing this NAFTA-on-steroids deal would undermine Obama's efforts to battle income inequality. It would be like drilling a hole in a boat just as you are trying to seal the cracks that are letting the water in.\"\nBackground: President Obama's references to trade in tonight's speech were similar to his 2013 SOTU trade mentions: \"To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union - because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.\" Tonight's speech also replayed the administration's standard statement on Fast Track, for instance in the 2013 Annual Trade Policy Agenda: \"To facilitate the conclusion, approval, and implementation of market-opening negotiating efforts, we will also work with Congress on Trade Promotion Authority. Such authority will guide current and future negotiations, and will thus support a jobs-focused trade agenda moving forward.\"\nA letter released Monday by more than 550 Democratic base organizations and a news conference today by Tea Party leaders against Fast Track reiterates the breadth of grassroots opposition. The letter included organizations such as MoveOn, SEIU, AFSCME and the American Federation of Teachers, that have not been involved in past \"trade\" fights and who are strong Obama supporters.\nPast trade pacts' role in fueling the growth of U.S. income inequality is animating new entrants into the Fast Track debate.

subsidy it opens a Pandora\u2019s Box. When it funds a social program it sets in motion a series of destructive consequences. I call it the Law of Progressive Ruin. Welfare serves as the perfect example. People who get a welfare payment come to rely on it. They often become dependent and permanently unemployed. Welfare invariably attracts new recipients and it grows over time. Food stamps serve as an example of this expansion. Most importantly social programs like this cannot be terminated because the politicians, the media and the voters will not allow it. The outcry would intimidate anyone who would dare suggest we eliminate rent subsidies, unemployment, welfare payments or food stamps.\nThese programs carry the seeds of their own destruction because they cannot be stopped and they constantly grow. All government programs and subsidies share these traits. Eventually, they must bankrupt the government that sponsors them. That\u2019s the only way they will be stopped. Then there will be hell to pay with civil unrest and financial chaos.\nThe moment a government makes the first give-away for a new program it sets in motion the Law of Progressive Ruin. Ultimately as time goes on these programs require more and more money until the government can no longer fund them. We are approaching that point in America.\nFurthermore, nobody should ever get money from the government that they didn\u2019t earn. That\u2019s because the government takes it forcibly from people who would not pay it voluntarily. The money necessary to help people must come privately through charity. This is the only moral process for aiding and assisting the indigent. This method will not bankrupt the nation, ruin its economy or expropriate the wealth of the entrepreneurs and productive citizens. It has the added benefit of being more temporary then permanent. This may work hardships on the poor at times but they will be much better for it then what\u2019s happening to them now.

{"url": "https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/jcsat-5.htm", "text": "In June 1996, Hughes Space and Communications International, Inc. (HSCI), signed a contract with Japan Satellite Systems, Inc., (JSAT) of Tokyo, to build a fifth communications satellite. In December 1996, JSAT contracted for a sixth satellite. The new satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6, are Hughes HS-601 body-stabilized model spacecraft. JCSAT-5 was successfully launched on December 2 1997 on an Ariane-44P H10-3 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. JCSAT-6 was launched 15 February 1999 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on an Atlas-2AS rocket. These new satellites will allow JSAT to meet increased customer demand for multimedia and Internet access and will carry voice, data and television signals to Japan.\nAs Hughes HS-601 satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 consist of a cube-shaped center payload section, with the solar panel wings extending from the north and south sides, and an antenna array. The 601 contains two modules. The first is the bus module which carries all launch vehicle loads and contains the propulsion system, bus electronics and battery packs. The second module is the payload module, which holds communications equipment and isothermal heat pipes. Reflectors, antenna feeds, and solar arrays mount directly to the primary structure, and antenna configurations can be placed on three faces of the bus. This modular approach enables work to proceed in parallel on both structures, which shortens manufacturing and test time. JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 were built in the Integrated Satellite Factory of Hughes Space and Communications Company in El Segundo, Calif.\nEach satellite has a pair of four-panel sun-tracking solar array wings. Each wing extends 11.9 meters north and south from the body for an overall deployed length of 26.2 meters. These panels are designed to generate approximately 5,000 Watts with the wings deployed, using K-4 3/4 solar cells. Additionally, a single 30-cell 200 Amp-hour, nickel-hydrogen battery provides power during eclipse periods.\nThe JCSAT-5 payload consists of 32 active Ku-band transponders. There are 16 transponders operating with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 60 Watts provided by a traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA); four operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, using 60 watt TWTAs; and 12 operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, each with 95 watt TWTAs. JSAT, using commands from the ground station, can combine four of the 36-Mhz transponders, resulting in two 76 MHz transponders with 95 Watts. JCSAT-6 also has 32 active Ku-band transponders with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 75 Watts provided by a TWTA.\nJCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 each have two octagonal reflectors, located on the east and west side of the bus. These reflectors make use of Hughes' patented shaped reflector technology, which eliminates the need for complex feedhorn arrays. With east and west reflectors deployed, the satellites measure 7.5 meters in width.\nJSAT contracted for launch directly with Arianespace for JCSAT-5 and with Lockheed Martin for JCSAT-6. After becoming operational, the satellites are refered by the designators JCSat 1B and JCSat 4A respectively.\nFor launch, the solar wings and reflectors fold alongside the spacecraft bus, forming a box 2.8 meters by 4.3 meters by 3.8 meters. After separation from the launch vehicle, the satellite's on-board 490-Newton (110 lbf) liquid apogee motor is fired to circularize the orbit at the 36,000 km (22,300 miles) geosynchronous altitude. The liquid bipropellant subsystem provides 12 thrusters of 22 Newtons (5 lbf) for stationkeeping. Once on-station, the satellites weigh approximately 1841 kg. JCSAT-5 is stationed at 150\u00b0 East longitude and JCSAT-6 is at 124\u00b0 East.\nOn 17. January 2005, JCSat 1B (5) experienced an anomaly in one of its thrusters, which led to temporary loss of services, while the operator prepare the satellite to operate without the faulty thruster.", "timestamp": 1556180164000, "doc_text": "In June 1996, Hughes Space and Communications International, Inc.

These new satellites will allow JSAT to meet increased customer demand for multimedia and Internet access and will carry voice, data and television signals to Japan.\nAs Hughes HS-601 satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 consist of a cube-shaped center payload section, with the solar panel wings extending from the north and south sides, and an antenna array. The 601 contains two modules. The first is the bus module which carries all launch vehicle loads and contains the propulsion system, bus electronics and battery packs. The second module is the payload module, which holds communications equipment and isothermal heat pipes. Reflectors, antenna feeds, and solar arrays mount directly to the primary structure, and antenna configurations can be placed on three faces of the bus. This modular approach enables work to proceed in parallel on both structures, which shortens manufacturing and test time. JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 were built in the Integrated Satellite Factory of Hughes Space and Communications Company in El Segundo, Calif.\nEach satellite has a pair of four-panel sun-tracking solar array wings. Each wing extends 11.9 meters north and south from the body for an overall deployed length of 26.2 meters. These panels are designed to generate approximately 5,000 Watts with the wings deployed, using K-4 3/4 solar cells. Additionally, a single 30-cell 200 Amp-hour, nickel-hydrogen battery provides power during eclipse periods.\nThe JCSAT-5 payload consists of 32 active Ku-band transponders. There are 16 transponders operating with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 60 Watts provided by a traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA); four operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, using 60 watt TWTAs; and 12 operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, each with 95 watt TWTAs. JSAT, using commands from the ground station, can combine four of the 36-Mhz transponders, resulting in two 76 MHz transponders with 95 Watts. JCSAT-6 also has 32 active Ku-band transponders with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 75 Watts provided by a TWTA.\nJCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 each have two octagonal reflectors, located on the east and west side of the bus. These reflectors make use of Hughes' patented shaped reflector technology, which eliminates the need for complex feedhorn arrays. With east and west reflectors deployed, the satellites measure 7.5 meters in width.\nJSAT contracted for launch directly with Arianespace for JCSAT-5 and with Lockheed Martin for JCSAT-6. After becoming operational, the satellites are refered by the designators JCSat 1B and JCSat 4A respectively.\nFor launch, the solar wings and reflectors fold alongside the spacecraft bus,",

(HSCI), signed a contract with Japan Satellite Systems, Inc., (JSAT) of Tokyo, to build a fifth communications satellite. In December 1996, JSAT contracted for a sixth satellite. The new satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6, are Hughes HS-601 body-stabilized model spacecraft. JCSAT-5 was successfully launched on December 2 1997 on an Ariane-44P H10-3 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. JCSAT-6 was launched 15 February 1999 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on an Atlas-2AS rocket. These new satellites will allow JSAT to meet increased customer demand for multimedia and Internet access and will carry voice, data and television signals to Japan.\nAs Hughes HS-601 satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 consist of a cube-shaped center payload section, with the solar panel wings extending from the north and south sides, and an antenna array. The 601 contains two modules. The first is the bus module which carries all launch vehicle loads and contains the propulsion system, bus electronics and battery packs. The second module is the payload module, which holds communications equipment and isothermal heat pipes. Reflectors, antenna feeds, and solar arrays mount directly to the primary structure, and antenna configurations can be placed on three faces of the bus. This modular approach enables work to proceed in parallel on both structures, which shortens manufacturing and test time. JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 were built in the Integrated Satellite Factory of Hughes Space and Communications Company in El Segundo, Calif.\nEach satellite has a pair of four-panel sun-tracking solar array wings. Each wing extends 11.9 meters north and south from the body for an overall deployed length of 26.2 meters. These panels are designed to generate approximately 5,000 Watts with the wings deployed, using K-4 3/4 solar cells. Additionally, a single 30-cell 200 Amp-hour, nickel-hydrogen battery provides power during eclipse periods.\nThe JCSAT-5 payload consists of 32 active Ku-band transponders. There are 16 transponders operating with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 60 Watts provided by a traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA); four operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, using 60 watt TWTAs; and 12 operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, each with 95 watt TWTAs. JSAT, using commands from the ground station, can combine four of the 36-Mhz transponders, resulting in two 76 MHz transponders with 95 Watts. JCSAT-6 also has 32 active Ku-band transponders with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 75 Watts provided by a TWTA.\nJCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 each have two octagonal reflectors, located on the east and west side of the bus. These reflectors make use of Hughes' patented shaped reflector technology, which eliminates the need for complex feedhorn arrays. With east and west reflectors deployed, the satellites measure 7.5 meters in width.\nJSAT contracted for launch directly with Arianespace for JCSAT-5 and with Lockheed Martin for JCSAT-6. After becoming operational, the satellites are refered by the designators JCSat 1B and JCSat 4A respectively.\nFor launch, the solar wings and reflectors fold alongside the spacecraft bus,",

{"url": "https://blog.mcny.org/2015/10/13/the-sporting-life-a-look-at-harry-t-peters-as-huntsman/", "text": "Harry Twyford Peters was born in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1881, and entered the coal business after graduating from Columbia College in 1903. He worked at Williams and Peters, his father\u2019s firm, later becoming a partner and its president. Peters inherited $500,000 dollars upon the death of his father in 1921\u2013the equivalent of over $6 million dollars by today\u2019s standard\u2013making him a very wealthy man. This fortune allowed Peters the leisure time to pursue personal and scholarly interests, in addition to his professional activities.\nPeters was an avid collector of American prints and a leading authority on Currier & Ives, a prolific American printmaking firm that was founded by Nathaniel Currier in 1934 in New York City, with James Merrit Ives joining as a partner in 1857. Peters is credited with recognizing the historic and artistic value of American lithographs during an era when they had fallen out of favor, and generating a new wave of interest by collectors and the public.\nPrint Issued by Currier & Ives. The Water Jump at Jerome Park, ca.1877. Museum of the City of New York, 57.100.83.\nPeters is the author of Currier & Ives: Printmakers to the American People (Doubleday, 1929), a \u201cChronicle of the Firm, and of the Artists and their Work, with Notes on Collecting,\u201d with reproductions of select works. The two volume set is the accepted catalog raisonn\u00e9 of the firm\u2019s work.\nPeters\u2019s estate donated nearly 2,300 Currier & Ives prints to the Museum in the early 1950s. The Museum also holds a manuscript collection related to Peters\u2019s life, work, and interests, which is believed to have been donated by his heirs around the same time. The Museum recently completed archival processing of the Peters papers thanks to the generous support of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation.\nAs Processing Archivist Annie Tummino worked her way through the Peters papers, we discovered that in addition to his interest in American lithography, Peters was an avid sportsman, with a passion for hunting, horses, and dogs.\nFreudy Photos, Inc. [Unidentified Hunt, ca. 1930s]. Museum of the City of New York, Harry T. Peters papers.\nIn 1925 he became Co-Master of Foxhounds of the Meadow Brooke Hunt in Long Island, New York, a position he held into the 1940s. Though the \u201ce\u201d was dropped off the end of \u201cBrooke\u201d at some point, Meadow Brook Club still occupies a portion of the land on the former Foxhall Parker Keene estate near Jericho, Long Island. The Long Island Expressway now cuts across the southern end of the property, and cars stream by, rather than foxes with dogs and mounted huntsmen in hot pursuit as they did in Peters\u2019s day. Peters was also a member of the Westminster Kennel Club and often served as an exhibitor and judge at dog shows.\nHunt map, Meadow Brooke Hounds, 1933. Museum of the City of New York, Harry T. Peters papers.\nIn processing the Peters papers, we found it was often difficult to draw a line between Peters\u2019s work as a scholar and collector of lithography, and his personal interests and hobbies. Two such examples include a lecture titled \u201cSport in Art through the Ages,\u201d and his text Just Hunting.\nUnknown photographer. [\u201cSport in Art\u201d at the Metropolitan Museum, 1937]. Museum of the City of New York, Harry T. Peters papers.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art sponsored the exhibition of sporting art in March 1937, with paintings and prints dating from the Middle Ages. Building on this event, Peters developed \u201cSport In Art Through the Ages,\u201d an illustrated lecture which he delivered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and later at the Grolier Club, an organization devoted to the \u201cstudy, collecting, and appreciation of books and works on paper, their art, history, production, and commerce.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Peters began a full length work on the same topic that was never published.\nPotential titles for \u201cJust Hunting,\u201d ca. 1935, in the Harry T. Peters papers. Museum of the City of New York.\nPeters did finish a book titled Just Hunting, which was published in 1935 by Scribner\u2019s (New York), and provides personal and historical perspectives on the subject. The book was illustrated by amateur artist and Long Island resident Betty Babcock. Ernest R. Gee later published Babcock\u2019s Illustrated Hunting Diary, Recording the Sport of the Season for the Followers of the Meadow Brook Hounds (circa 1945).\nIllustration layout for \u201cJust Hunting,\u201d 1935, in the Harry T. Peters papers. Museum of the City of New York.\nPeters described Just Hunting as \u201cthe random findings of an American business man who would that he could have been born a sportsman.\u201d Luckily for Peters, he seems to have had adequate time away from his business to pursue the sporting life he so desired.\nThis entry was posted on October 13, 2015 by Lindsay Turley in Manuscripts and Ephemera and tagged Currier & Ives, Dogs, Harry Twyford Peters (1881-1948), Hunting, James Merritt Ives (1824-1895), Lithography, Meadow Brooke Hounds, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, Museum of the City of New York, N.Y.), Nathaniel Currier (1813-1888), Sporting, Sportsman, Westminster Kennel Club.", "timestamp": 1555801006000, "doc_text": "Harry Twyford Peters was born in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1881, and entered the coal business after graduating from Columbia College in 1903.", "token_ids_start_true": [7384, 217674, 5008, 34034, 9095, 45151, 1005, 10510, 1268, 1264, 160427, 1005, 1265, 14980, 6628, 1488, 145719, 1283, 11008, 71061, 1264, 115968, 1295], "token_texts_start_true": ["\u2581Harry", "\u2581Twy", "ford", "\u2581Peters", "\u2581was\u2581born\u2581in", "\u2581Greenwich", ",", "\u2581Connecticut", "\u2581in", "\u2581", "1881", ",", "\u2581and", "\u2581entered\u2581the", "\u2581coal", "\u2581business", "\u2581after\u2581graduating", "\u2581from", "\u2581Columbia", "\u2581College\u2581in", "\u2581", "1903", "."], "token_ids_start_false": [154560, 217674, 5008, 34034, 9095, 45151, 1005, 10510, 1268, 1264, 160427, 1005, 1265, 14980, 6628, 1488, 145719, 1283, 11008, 71061, 1264, 115968, 1295], "decoded_text_from_start_true": "Harry Twyford Peters was born in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1881, and entered the coal business after graduating from Columbia College in 1903.", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 5], [5, 9], [9, 13], [13, 20], [20, 32], [32, 42], [42, 43], [43, 55], [55, 58], [58, 59], [59, 63], [63, 64], [64, 68], [68, 80], [80, 85], [85, 94], [94, 111], [111, 116], [116, 125], [125, 136], [136, 137], [137, 141], [141, 142]]}

I usually get up around 6:30 a.m. and the very first thing I do is check my phone\u2014of course. I have friends who forget my parental sleeping habits and will call me at 3 a.m., so during the night I keep my phone away from me and turned off.\nThen, I go make my coffee. My husband and I are really into our coffee, so I enjoy the process of making it\u2014and drinking it. Then, the next few hours are really devoted to getting my kids up and out. Sometimes, I don\u2019t even look in the mirror until I\u2019m home from dropping them off [at school]; I just throw on something easy. I love Christy Dawn Jumpsuits\u2014I have it in a ton of colors and it\u2019s so chic and easy, but my kids like to joke that I look like a sausage!\nOnce I\u2019m home, my day can begin. Three to four days a week in the mornings, I have a trainer come to the house to help me work out. I really don\u2019t love it\u2014I would so much rather eat cake\u2014but I have pre-diabetes and exercise is one of the major measures to help reverse the effects. I love nature, so we\u2019ll hike for a half-hour and then do resistance training for a half-hour. Once I\u2019m done with my workout, I\u2019ll sometimes do Transcendental Meditation. I try to meditate twice a day, but sometimes it makes me too tired so I\u2019ll occasionally skip it and scroll through Instagram instead.\nFor breakfast, I have the same exact thing every single day: a smoothie with unsweetened almond milk, my nutritionist David Allen\u2019s Chocolate Protein Powder, a tablespoon of nut butter, and ice. It keeps my blood sugar leveled and keeps me full.\nAfter breakfast I always pack a bunch of snacks for my day, too, to make sure my levels stay even. I\u2019ll pack almonds, blackberries, sometimes an apple and nut butter\u2014I put them in special bags and bring them to all my meetings and appointments. Wellness is a major part of my life right now, so I\u2019m just trying to be as conscious and healthy as possible. I\u2019m crazy about how much water I drink: I pack a cooler with bottles, leave it in the back of my car, and I make sure to drink all of them by the end the day.\nMy beauty routine is pretty simple. I clean my face, make sure to apply a ton of sunscreen and moisturizer, and I\u2019m on my way. Truthfully, I tend to bring my makeup bag in the car with me for my meetings\u2014I\u2019ve got it down to a 10-minute science. I could probably do it with my eyes closed\u2014I do my brows, a little lip, and swipe some mascara, and I\u2019m done.\nFor more brilliant advice, check out the Suri-approved breakfast that fuels Katie Holmes\u2019 day or the healthy beauty secret that all supermodels swear by, according to Veronica Webb.", "timestamp": 1555750845000, "doc_text": "Welcome to My Morning Routine, where Amanda De Cadenet and other good-life gurus share their personal (frequently surprising, often healthy) morning rituals\u2014to help you make your a.m.\u2019s more awesome.\nI\u2019m an early riser thanks to my 9-year-old twins.

Morning Routine, where Amanda De Cadenet and other good-life gurus share their personal (frequently surprising, often healthy) morning rituals\u2014to help you make your a.m.\u2019s more awesome.\nI\u2019m an early riser thanks to my 9-year-old twins. I usually get up around 6:30 a.m. and the very first thing I do is check my phone\u2014of course. I have friends who forget my parental sleeping habits and will call me at 3 a.m., so during the night I keep my phone away from me and turned off.\nThen, I go make my coffee. My husband and I are really into our coffee, so I enjoy the process of making it\u2014and drinking it. Then, the next few hours are really devoted to getting my kids up and out. Sometimes, I don\u2019t even look in the mirror until I\u2019m home from dropping them off [at school]; I just throw on something easy. I love Christy Dawn Jumpsuits\u2014I have it in a ton of colors and it\u2019s so chic and easy, but my kids like to joke that I look like a sausage!\nOnce I\u2019m home, my day can begin. Three to four days a week in the mornings, I have a trainer come to the house to help me work out. I really don\u2019t love it\u2014I would so much rather eat cake\u2014but I have pre-diabetes and exercise is one of the major measures to help reverse the effects. I love nature, so we\u2019ll hike for a half-hour and then do resistance training for a half-hour. Once I\u2019m done with my workout, I\u2019ll sometimes do Transcendental Meditation. I try to meditate twice a day, but sometimes it makes me too tired so I\u2019ll occasionally skip it and scroll through Instagram instead.\nFor breakfast, I have the same exact thing every single day: a smoothie with unsweetened almond milk, my nutritionist David Allen\u2019s Chocolate Protein Powder, a tablespoon of nut butter, and ice. It keeps my blood sugar leveled and keeps me full.\nAfter breakfast I always pack a bunch of snacks for my day, too, to make sure my levels stay even. I\u2019ll pack almonds, blackberries, sometimes an apple and nut butter\u2014I put them in special bags and bring them to all my meetings and appointments. Wellness is a major part of my life right now, so I\u2019m just trying to be as conscious and healthy as possible. I\u2019m crazy about how much water I drink: I pack a cooler with bottles, leave it in the", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 10], [10, 13], [13, 21], [21, 29], [29, 30], [30, 36], [36, 43], [43, 46], [46, 51], [51, 54], [54, 64], [64, 69], [69, 74], [74, 80], [80, 86], [86, 101], [101, 102], [102, 103], [103, 113], [113, 124], [124, 125], [125, 131], [131, 139], [139, 140], [140, 148], [148, 156], [156, 157], [157, 159], [159, 168], [168, 178], [178, 183], [183, 185], [185, 190], [190, 198], [198, 199], [199, 200], [200, 203], [203, 212], [212, 218], [218, 228], [228, 231], [231, 232], [232, 233], [233, 242], [242, 248], [248, 249], [249, 259], [259, 266], [266, 273], [273, 274], [274, 275], [275, 276], [276, 278], [278, 283], [283, 287], [287, 302], [302, 308], [308, 313], [313, 316], [316, 322], [322, 331], [331, 332], [332, 341], [341, 342], [342, 349], [349, 361], [361, 368], [368, 371], [371, 380], [380, 389], [389, 400], [400, 405], [405, 413], [413, 416], [416, 417], [417, 418], [418, 423], [423, 424], [424, 427], [427, 444], [444, 451], [451, 460], [460, 473], [473, 477], [477, 488], [488, 489], [489, 490], [490, 494], [494, 495], [495, 500], [500, 505], [505, 515], [515, 516], [516, 533], [533, 544], [544, 553], [553, 560], [560, 561], [561, 564], [564, 572], [572, 594], [594, 597], [597, 598], [598, 601], [601, 610], [610, 613], [613, 614], [614, 619], [619, 620], [620, 629], [629, 639], [639, 650], [650, 661], [661, 669], [669, 677], [677, 684], [684, 688], [688, 689], [689, 699], [699, 700], [700, 713], [713, 732], [732, 738], [738, 742], [742, 752], [752, 761], [761, 770], [770, 772], [772, 774], [774, 781], [781, 783], [783, 790], [790, 796], [796, 809], [809, 814], [814, 815], [815, 822], [822, 830], [830, 835], [835, 840], [840, 844], [844, 845], [845, 846], [846, 852], [852, 858], [858, 867], [867, 878], [878, 886], [886, 891], [891, 900], [900, 901], [901, 905], [905, 913], [913, 918], [918, 921], [921, 926], [926, 933], [933, 945], [945, 953], [953, 954], [954, 955], [955, 959], [959, 963], [963, 968], [968, 969], [969, 976], [976, 986], [986, 987], [987, 993], [993, 1001], [1001, 1013], [1013, 1029], [1029, 1030], [1030, 1039], [1039, 1047], [1047, 1055], [1055, 1065], [1065, 1076], [1076, 1085], [1085, 1086], [1086, 1101], [1101, 1109], [1109, 1110], [1110, 1111], [1111, 1117], [1117, 1125], [1125, 1132], [1132, 1136], [1136, 1141], [1141, 1142], [1142, 1145], [1145, 1152], [1152, 1156], [1156, 1157], [1157, 1165], [1165, 1178], [1178, 1198], [1198, 1207], [1207, 1215], [1215, 1227], [1227, 1235], [1235, 1236], [1236, 1243], [1243, 1250], [1250, 1251], [1251, 1254], [1254, 1260], [1260, 1265], [1265, 1269], [1269, 1281], [1281, 1290], [1290, 1293], [1293, 1313], [1313, 1317], [1317, 1329], [1329, 1330], [1330, 1335], [1335, 1339], [1339, 1349], [1349, 1352], [1352, 1360], [1360, 1361], [1361, 1366], [1366, 1376], [1376, 1379], [1379, 1394], [1394, 1405], [1405, 1406], [1406, 1415], [1415, 1424], [1424, 1436], [1436, 1437], [1437, 1451], [1451, 1463], [1463, 1467], [1467, 1473], [1473, 1476], [1476, 1481], [1481, 1494], [1494, 1499], [1499, 1502], [1502, 1506], [1506, 1521], [1521, 1531], [1531, 1539], [1539, 1540], [1540, 1541], [1541, 1544], [1544, 1554], [1554, 1555], [1555, 1562], [1562, 1577], [1577, 1583], [1583, 1600], [1600, 1601], [1601, 1603], [1603, 1612], [1612, 1617], [1617, 1629], [1629, 1641], [1641, 1642], [1642, 1645], [1645, 1658], [1658, 1664], [1664, 1670], [1670, 1672], [1672, 1682], [1682, 1690], [1690, 1697], [1697, 1698], [1698, 1711], [1711, 1714], [1714, 1725], [1725, 1726], [1726, 1730], [1730, 1734], [1734, 1735], [1735, 1744], [1744, 1747], [1747, 1759], [1759, 1767], [1767, 1771], [1771, 1780], [1780, 1785], [1785, 1786], [1786, 1787], [1787, 1802], [1802, 1811], [1811, 1816], [1816, 1827], [1827, 1834], [1834, 1838], [1838, 1845], [1845, 1846], [1846, 1850], [1850, 1851], [1851, 1864], [1864, 1867], [1867, 1874], [1874, 1879], [1879, 1884], [1884, 1885], [1885, 1890], [1890, 1895], [1895, 1903], [1903, 1904], [1904, 1917], [1917, 1918], [1918, 1928], [1928, 1937], [1937, 1941], [1941, 1952], [1952, 1953], [1953, 1954], [1954, 1966], [1966, 1974], [1974, 1983], [1983, 1997], [1997, 2004], [2004, 2017], [2017, 2030], [2030, 2031], [2031, 2040], [2040, 2051], [2051, 2067], [2067, 2077], [2077, 2078], [2078, 2081], [2081, 2090], [2090, 2103], [2103, 2106], [2106, 2116], [2116, 2128], [2128, 2140], [2140, 2141], [2141, 2145], [2145, 2151], [2151, 2166], [2166, 2172], [2172, 2174], [2174, 2180], [2180, 2181], [2181, 2183], [2183, 2188], [2188, 2190], [2190, 2197], [2197, 2202], [2202, 2210], [2210, 2211], [2211, 2220], [2220, 2227]]}

Depending on the conservatory design, it may not even be necessary to get planning permission for your new property addition.\nCosts, and quality, can vary dramatically \u2013 ensure that you use a reputable but competitively priced conservatory company with Consumer Advisory.\nContact us with details of your project. A Quantity Surveyor will visit your property, determine your exact requirements.\nOnce we have this information, we will arrange for 3 reputable and respected conservatory companies to get back to you with fixed quotes.\nYou can either employ the quantity surveyor to project manage the building of your conservatory, or you can use the quotes to choose the best service and manage everything yourself.\nAn experienced quantity surveyor has years of experience in the industry, and they will be able to identify any potential problems early in the process. They will agree prices and deadlines and ensure that the construction company meets them. They will prevent additional costs and delays, and will be responsible for dealing with all suppliers and contractors during the completion of the project.\nConservatories became popular during the economic crisis. They offered a more cost-effective means of increasing living space without having to sell an existing property and buy a new one. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which means that custom built conservatories can be used for unusual spaces, and small conservatories can be added even when space is limited.\nAs well as being affected by the design and dimensions, the position of the conservatory, and the materials that are used, the additional features in your conservatory will have a direct impact on the cost that you pay for your completed room. For example, if you want to incorporate central heating into your room, this increases cost.\nAlthough conservatory costs can vary dramatically, you should expect to pay between \u00a34,000 and \u00a37,000 for a small, standard sized, lean-to conservatory.\nVictorian conservatories will cost around \u00a36,000 to \u00a310,000 for the simplest and cheapest option, while P-shape and L-shape conservatories attract a minimum cost of \u00a315,000.\nCosts can rise considerably if you have unique requirements or need any unusual elements.\nThe primary benefit of installing new conservatories is the additional living space that it affords the homeowner. The room can be used for anything from a sun room or study to a gym or games room.\nA new conservatory is likely to be cheaper than selling your existing home and moving into a new property, while still enabling you to scale up.\nIf the conservatory matches the style of the rest of the property and offers genuine value to the homeowner, it could increase property value by as much as 7% of the property valuation.\nA conservatory enables you to bring the outdoors inside. The glass windows and translucent roof mean that you can enjoy the sun all year round, while the natural wooden design that is common means that you can add wicker furniture and plants to give the conservatory a real outdoor feel.\nDifferent styles of conservatory have different benefits and potential uses.\nThe lean-to conservatory is a simple conservatory and is usually the cheapest option available. The pitched roof slopes away from the wall, and these conservatories are typically used to extend the rear of a property and protrude from the main house. However, if you have an L shaped property rear, you can use the conservatory to fill in the blank space.\nThe Victorian conservatory is the most popular style available. It suits all property styles and shapes. It features a bay front and a steeply pitched roof. It also includes a detailed ridge design, and this is the style that instantly springs to mind when most people hear the word conservatory.\nThe Edwardian conservatory, which may also be called the Georgian conservatory, has become increasingly popular. It has a square or rectangular shape, which gives it convenient dimensions for laying out furniture and other accessories. There is no wasted space, and the sloping roof gives the Edwardian sun room real impact.\nA P-Shape conservatory combines a lean-to and Victorian conservatory design. This type of design suits larger properties that have a lot of outdoor space available for use. The Victorian element of the conservatory design can be three-faceted or five-faceted. Because this, and the L-Shape conservatory below, extends in two different directions, it offers the versatility to incorporate two separate living spaces in your new property addition.\nAn L-Shape conservatory offers many of the same benefits as a P-Shape room; potentially more so. It combines a rectangular lean-to design with a square or rectangular Edwardian design. The straight lines mean that furniture can be pushed to the edge of the room, and no space is wasted.\nThere are a lot of potential uses for a conservatory. It acts as a compromise between a full extension and no extension whatsoever. It can also work as a compromise between outdoor and indoor space. Add some plants and natural materials and it will feel as though you\u2019re sat in the garden rather than in a newly extended section of the house.\nCreate a new dining room with stunning views. Dining rooms can be quite dark and enclosed, and they tend to have multiple uses \u2013 they are games rooms to keep the kids out of the living room, they are homework rooms, computer rooms, and they offer an area to sit and eat. By adding a conservatory, you can create a light, airy, and beautiful space to eat, and leave the dining room for other applications. A breakfast room offers similar use to that of a dining room.\nNatural light helps us concentrate, and this is something that is produced in abundance when you have a new conservatory. Turn your new conservatory into a study or a home office and you will have access to this natural light whenever you work.\nAnother common use for conservatory design is as a plant room. Essentially, this becomes a seating and relaxation area \u2013 add potted plants, use natural materials in the design and in the furniture, and you can create a space that feels like it falls somewhere between living room and rear garden.\nTurn your conservatory into a gym, games room, or play room. The conservatory will basically become a separate section of the house, which means that you can let the kids go wild, or you can use the room as a separate gym.\nThere are many other potential uses for this room of the house, and a conservatory installer can help ensure that you get the right dimensions, the right style, and the right layout for whatever purpose you have for your new room.\nWhen you use Consumer Advisory, we will arrange for a qualified Quantity Surveyor to visit your property. You can discuss your requirements, including the desired position, the likely use of the room, and the dimensions. The surveyor will look at your requirements. They will determine exactly what\u2019s needed, including whether you will require planning permission, and they will provide these details to our network of trusted conservatory installers and fitters. You will receive three fixed price quotes, and you can even have your surveyor act as a project manager to ensure that everything is completed to budget and on schedule.\nWe can get you free, competitive quotes from vetted conservatory companies in Kent, Sussex and Surrey who offer high quality and competitive pricing.

"decoded_text_from_start_true": "Conservatories represent a beneficial way of extending a property without the same costs or upheaval associated with having a full extension. Depending on the conservatory design, it may not even be necessary to get planning permission for your new property addition.\nCosts, and quality, can vary dramatically \u2013 ensure that you use a reputable but competitively priced conservatory company with Consumer Advisory.\nContact us with details of your project. A Quantity Surveyor will visit your property, determine your exact requirements.\nOnce we have this information, we will arrange for 3 reputable and respected conservatory companies to get back to you with fixed quotes.\nYou can either employ the quantity surveyor to project manage the building of your conservatory, or you can use the quotes to choose the best service and manage everything yourself.\nAn experienced quantity surveyor has years of experience in the industry, and they will be able to identify any potential problems early in the process. They will agree prices and deadlines and ensure that the construction company meets them. They will prevent additional costs and delays, and will be responsible for dealing with all suppliers and contractors during the completion of the project.\nConservatories became popular during the economic crisis. They offered a more cost-effective means of increasing living space without having to sell an existing property and buy a new one. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which means that custom built conservatories can be used for unusual spaces, and small conservatories can be added even when space is limited.\nAs well as being affected by the design and dimensions, the position of the conservatory, and the materials that are used, the additional features in your conservatory will have a direct impact on the cost that you pay for your completed room. For example, if you want to incorporate central heating into your room, this increases cost.\nAlthough conservatory costs can vary dramatically, you should expect to pay between \u00a34,000 and \u00a37,000 for a small, standard sized, lean-to conservatory.\nVictorian conservatories will cost around \u00a36,000 to \u00a310,000 for the simplest and cheapest option, while P-shape and L-shape conservatories attract a minimum cost of \u00a315,000.\nCosts can rise considerably if you have unique requirements or need any unusual elements.\nThe primary benefit of installing new conservatories is the additional living space that it affords the homeowner. The room can be used for anything from a sun room or study to a gym or games room.\nA new conservatory is likely to be cheaper than selling your existing home and moving into a new property, while still enabling you to scale up.\nIf the conservatory matches the style of the rest of the property and offers genuine value to the homeowner, it could increase property value by as much as 7% of the property valuation.\nA conservatory enables you to bring the outdoors inside. The glass windows and translucent roof mean that you can enjoy the sun all year round, while the natural wooden design that is common means that you can add wicker furniture and plants to give the conservatory a real outdoor feel.\nDifferent styles of conservatory have different benefits and potential uses.\nThe lean-to conservatory is a simple conservatory and is usually the cheapest option available. The pitched roof slopes away from the wall, and these conservatories are typically used to extend the rear of a property and protrude from the main house. However, if you have an L shaped property rear, you can use the conservatory to fill in the blank space.\nThe Victorian conservatory is the most popular style available. It suits all property styles and shapes. It features a bay front and a steeply pitched roof. It also includes a detailed ridge design, and this is the style that instantly springs to mind when most people hear the word conservatory.\nThe Edwardian conservatory, which may also be called the Georgian conservatory, has become increasingly popular. It has a square or rectangular shape, which gives it convenient dimensions for laying out furniture and other accessories. There is no wasted space, and the sloping roof gives the Edwardian sun room real impact.\nA P-Shape conservatory combines a lean-to and Victorian conservatory design. This type of design suits larger properties that have a lot of outdoor space available for use. The Victorian element of the conservatory design can be three-faceted or five-faceted. Because this, and the L-Shape conservatory below, extends in two different directions, it offers the versatility to incorporate two separate living spaces in your new property addition.\nAn L-Shape conservatory offers many of the same benefits as a P-Shape room; potentially more so. It combines a rectangular lean-to design with a square or rectangular Edwardian design. The straight lines mean that furniture can be pushed to the edge of the room, and no space is wasted.\nThere are a lot of potential uses for a conservatory. It acts as a compromise between a full extension and no extension whatsoever. It can also work as a compromise between outdoor and indoor space. Add some plants and natural materials and it will feel as though you\u2019re sat in the garden rather than in a newly extended section of the house.\nCreate a new dining room with stunning views. Dining rooms can be quite dark and enclosed, and they tend to have multiple uses \u2013 they are games rooms to keep the kids out of the living room, they are homework rooms, computer rooms, and they

Salmon Oil available for your dogs, from Avena Phytotherapy Ltd, who produce top quality Veterinary Herbal Medicene.\nThe health benefits of fish oils are now widely accepted and I am sure most of you are already giving them to your pets, and taking them yourselves.\nIn brief fish oils contain omega 3 fatty acids. EPA and DHA are the two most widely researched to date. Maintaining the balance between Omega 3 and Omega 6 fats in our bodies is one of the important factors in reducing inflammation. Western processed diets high in cereals result in high levels of Omega 6\u2019s so it is important to supplement with Omega3\u2019s, or eat lots of fish.\nEPA also has a direct anti inflammatory action by blocking the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway which is what makes fish oil so effective for joint pain.\nFish oils have been shown to benefit joints, eyes, skin, brain and kidneys and also to help with healthy ageing by reducing cognitive decline.\nFish oils are highly unstable by their nature and rapidly oxidise (i.e. become rancid) in contact with air. Once oxidised (rancid) they can no longer impart that antioxidant effect when taken.\nA bottle of salmon oil will oxidise within a week of opening or less. Pump topped bottles will do the same as air is sucked back into the bottle as you use the product.\nOur unique airless pouches ensure that our oil stays fresh and fully active to the last drop!\nDogs over 25 kgs get 3 pumps twice daily in food.\nMuch larger dogs eg 50kg+ may require 4 pumps twice daily", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 8], [8, 24], [24, 39], [39, 46], [46, 50], [50, 64], [64, 73], [73, 74], [74, 75], [75, 80], [80, 82], [82, 86], [86, 92], [92, 99], [99, 103], [103, 104], [104, 108], [108, 116], [116, 128], [128, 139], [139, 146], [146, 152], [152, 155], [155, 156], [156, 157], [157, 160], [160, 179], [179, 188], [188, 197], [197, 213], [213, 217], [217, 227], [227, 239], [239, 251], [251, 263], [263, 266], [266, 276], [276, 277], [277, 281], [281, 293], [293, 304], [304, 305], [305, 306], [306, 314], [314, 323], [323, 332], [332, 338], [338, 339], [339, 340], [340, 352], [352, 353], [353, 357], [357, 361], [361, 365], [365, 377], [377, 382], [382, 389], [389, 400], [400, 408], [408, 409], [409, 421], [421, 425], [425, 441], [441, 447], [447, 448], [448, 449], [449, 453], [453, 459], [459, 460], [460, 461], [461, 466], [466, 469], [469, 480], [480, 494], [494, 512], [512, 524], [524, 537], [537, 538], [538, 546], [546, 556], [556, 562], [562, 570], [570, 578], [578, 588], [588, 589], [589, 603], [603, 609], [609, 610], [610, 611], [611, 613], [613, 616], [616, 635], [635, 646], [646, 651], [651, 657], [657, 658], [658, 660], [660, 661], [661, 664], [664, 668], [668, 676], [676, 681], [681, 682], [682, 683], [683, 686], [686, 697], [697, 704], [704, 709], [709, 722], [722, 729], [729, 741], [741, 745], [745, 762], [762, 763], [763, 764], [764, 766], [766, 767], [767, 775], [775, 781], [781, 795], [795, 804], [804, 807], [807, 817], [817, 821], [821, 832], [832, 833], [833, 834], [834, 838], [838, 843], [843, 862], [862, 870], [870, 877], [877, 878], [878, 883], [883, 884], [884, 889], [889, 890], [890, 896], [896, 900], [900, 908], [908, 917], [917, 930], [930, 938], [938, 945], [945, 957], [957, 975], [975, 976], [976, 977], [977, 981], [981, 986], [986, 997], [997, 1006], [1006, 1015], [1015, 1026], [1026, 1034], [1034, 1041], [1041, 1042], [1042, 1043], [1043, 1044], [1044, 1048], [1048, 1055], [1055, 1062], [1062, 1063], [1063, 1079], [1079, 1083], [1083, 1084], [1084, 1089], [1089, 1096], [1096, 1098], [1098, 1099], [1099, 1100], [1100, 1103], [1103, 1106], [1106, 1107], [1107, 1116], [1116, 1126], [1126, 1133], [1133, 1138], [1138, 1150], [1150, 1157], [1157, 1162], [1162, 1168], [1168, 1169], [1169, 1170], [1170, 1171], [1171, 1181], [1181, 1188], [1188, 1192], [1192, 1197], [1197, 1204], [1204, 1205], [1205, 1219], [1219, 1222], [1222, 1230], [1230, 1238], [1238, 1239], [1239, 1244], [1244, 1251], [1251, 1259], [1259, 1276], [1276, 1279], [1279, 1283], [1283, 1286], [1286, 1293], [1293, 1307], [1307, 1314], [1314, 1317], [1317, 1325], [1325, 1337], [1337, 1338], [1338, 1339], [1339, 1349], [1349, 1353], [1353, 1357], [1357, 1365], [1365, 1377], [1377, 1381], [1381, 1385], [1385, 1391], [1391, 1401], [1401, 1407], [1407, 1414], [1414, 1426], [1426, 1431], [1431, 1432], [1432, 1433], [1433, 1437], [1437, 1442], [1442, 1443], [1443, 1445], [1445, 1448], [1448, 1449], [1449, 1453], [1453, 1454], [1454, 1455], [1455, 1461], [1461, 1473], [1473, 1476], [1476, 1481], [1481, 1482], [1482, 1483], [1483, 1487], [1487, 1494], [1494, 1499], [1499, 1502], [1502, 1503], [1503, 1505], [1505, 1507], [1507, 1508], [1508, 1520], [1520, 1521], [1521, 1522], [1522, 1528], [1528, 1540]]}

rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs cooled down the Toronto Raptors with a 100-80 decision at AT&T Center.\nManu Ginobili followed with 14 points, while Tony Parker added 13 and seven assists for San Antonio, which won its third straight game.\nAlan Anderson and Amir Johnson each netted 12 points to pace the Raptors, who had their season-high five-game win streak snapped.\nTerrence Ross and John Lucas III scored 11 points apiece off the bench in a losing effort.\n\"That is probably the best team in the NBA right now. They&apos;re playing well together,\" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said about the Spurs. \"The few days of good practice they had and we took days off showed.\"\nSan Antonio connected on four of its first six shots from the floor while the Raptors went just 1-for-6 from the field to give the Spurs an early 9-3 lead.\nToronto netted the next five points to close its gap to one, but the Raptors would get no closer until Johnson later capped a 6-0 push with a layup to knot the game at 16-16 with a little over two minutes left in the first quarter.\nThe Spurs, however, scored six of the final eight points of the frame and carried a 22-18 lead into the second quarter.\nToronto followed Stephen Jackson&apos;s opening basket of the second with an 11-3 spurt to take its first lead of the game at 29-27.\nThe lead would exchange hands three times from there as the teams traded blows, with the last coming on a pair of Danny Green free throws as part of a 14-4 run by the Spurs over the final three-plus minutes of the half to give them a 44-37 advantage at the break.\nAfter Duncan drained a jumper to start the scoring in the third quarter, the Raptors battled back with an 11-5 push to get within 51-48.\nSan Antonio responded with six straight points to regain a nine-point edge and following a brief 5-0 spurt by Toronto that brought the Raptors back within 57-53, the Spurs closed out the third with a 13-4 run to take a 70-57 lead into the fourth quarter.\nToronto never threatened in the final stanza, trailing by double digits throughout the entire fourth quarter.\n\"I thought our defense was very good in the second half,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"They did a much better job in the pick-and-roll and our pace was better offensively.

{"url": "http://timelessvintagethreads.com/", "text": "If you know what you\u2019re doing, it can be quite Easy to Clean Fitted Crib Sheets and other kinds of sheets and comforters. As a parent, you have to take care of your kid\u2019s beddings to make sure they are clean at all times. Sheets and comforters can gather dust easily and you should try to change them every week. There are easy ways to clean sheets that would make them last longer and retain their quality and freshness. It goes beyond just throwing them in the washer. Below we discuss the best ways to clean fitted sheets and other kinds of sheets as well.\nWhen doing laundry, pay attention so you don\u2019t leave your sheets in the washer or dryer after the wash cycle is done. Leaving them to sit in the dryer or washer will cause them to wrinkle up. You do not want to go through the hassle of ironing your fitted sheets especially if it\u2019s a large household with lots of sheets. Take the sheets out of the dryer immediately and if you want to ensure they remain straight and without wrinkles, spread them out on the bed to cool. This will leave them looking ironed and feeling brand new.\nThis is very important when you are washing fitted sheets and flat sheets that will be used to dress a baby\u2019s crib or a toddlers bed. It is also important for adults as well. Harsh detergents can damage the sheets and they can also cause irritation to the skin \u2013 even more so for babies that have sensitive and delicate skin. Try to use gentler detergents or natural detergents and not only will they extend the life of your sheets, but they will also not pose a threat to your skin or your baby\u2019s skin. Also be careful fo the detergent you buy, some have weird coloring or really cheap chemicals that just straight up damage your clothes.\nI get tempted to put the wash cycle on very hot a lot because it makes me feel like the hot water cleans the clothes the best. This might be true for some situations but not for fitted sheets, When you wash fitted sheets and flat sheets in hot water and then tumble dry them in dry heat it will lead to the sheets shrinking. You might not notice it after the first couple of times but constantly doing this will cause your fitted sheets to get smaller and smaller and soon you just realize they don\u2019t fit anymore and you have to get new ones. If you just can\u2019t do without washing your fitted sheets at high temperature, then you can buy sheets that are a size or two bigger.\nWashing your fitted sheets without washing the duvet cover and the flat sheet kind of defeats the purpose. The bed will still be dirty and it might cause the fitted sheets to get dirty quicker. Try to wash the duvet cover every two weeks or once a month if you don\u2019t have the time.\nA down comforter is very comfortable and its one of the best options for staying warm in bed during the cold months like in autumn and winter. A comforter might not be able to provide much comfort if it\u2019s not properly cared for. A down comforter is made up of light feathers that are stitched together in a patter. They are usually quite heavy so you will need a heavy duty and large capacity washing machine to clean them properly. If you do not have this size washing machine at home, then you can take your down comforter to the laundromat. Attempting to wash a down comforter in a small machine that does not fit is a bad idea.\nWhen washing, wash them in a gentle cycle and use a mild detergent. Also, don\u2019t use a lot of detergents, a small amount is best. Too much detergent might cause the down to strip away. For a down comforter, it is better to rinse it in two cycles to make sure all the soap is rinsed out. For drying purposes, a low capacity dryer is a bad idea. Use a high capacity dryer and put it on low heating so the dryer is gentle on the comforter.\nMake sure the comforter is dried properly otherwise it could lead to a moldy situation with the feathers. While drying, pause the dryer a few times and take the comforter out to give it a fluff. You could get the kids in the house to help with this as they will love it. Unlike skeets and duvet covers, you should wash your down comforters once a year. If this sounds like too much hassle, then take your down cover to professional to get it professionally cleaned and taken care of.", "timestamp": 1556001280000, "doc_text": "If you know what you\u2019re doing, it can be quite Easy to Clean Fitted Crib Sheets and other kinds of sheets and comforters.

be quite Easy to Clean Fitted Crib Sheets and other kinds of sheets and comforters. As a parent, you have to take care of your kid\u2019s beddings to make sure they are clean at all times. Sheets and comforters can gather dust easily and you should try to change them every week. There are easy ways to clean sheets that would make them last longer and retain their quality and freshness. It goes beyond just throwing them in the washer. Below we discuss the best ways to clean fitted sheets and other kinds of sheets as well.\nWhen doing laundry, pay attention so you don\u2019t leave your sheets in the washer or dryer after the wash cycle is done. Leaving them to sit in the dryer or washer will cause them to wrinkle up. You do not want to go through the hassle of ironing your fitted sheets especially if it\u2019s a large household with lots of sheets. Take the sheets out of the dryer immediately and if you want to ensure they remain straight and without wrinkles, spread them out on the bed to cool. This will leave them looking ironed and feeling brand new.\nThis is very important when you are washing fitted sheets and flat sheets that will be used to dress a baby\u2019s crib or a toddlers bed. It is also important for adults as well. Harsh detergents can damage the sheets and they can also cause irritation to the skin \u2013 even more so for babies that have sensitive and delicate skin. Try to use gentler detergents or natural detergents and not only will they extend the life of your sheets, but they will also not pose a threat to your skin or your baby\u2019s skin. Also be careful fo the detergent you buy, some have weird coloring or really cheap chemicals that just straight up damage your clothes.\nI get tempted to put the wash cycle on very hot a lot because it makes me feel like the hot water cleans the clothes the best. This might be true for some situations but not for fitted sheets, When you wash fitted sheets and flat sheets in hot water and then tumble dry them in dry heat it will lead to the sheets shrinking. You might not notice it after the first couple of times but constantly doing this will cause your fitted sheets to get smaller and smaller and soon you just realize they don\u2019t fit anymore and you have to get new ones. If you just can\u2019t do without washing your fitted sheets at high temperature, then you can buy sheets that are a size or two bigger.\nWashing your fitted sheets without washing the duvet cover and the flat sheet kind of defeats the purpose. The bed will still be dirty and it might cause the fitted sheets to get dirty quicker. Try to wash the duvet cover every two weeks or once a month if you don\u2019t have the time.\nA down comforter is very comfortable and its one of the best options for staying warm in bed during the cold months like in autumn and winter. A comforter might not be able to provide much comfort if it\u2019s not properly cared for. A down comforter is made up of light feathers that are stitched together in a patter. They are usually quite heavy so you will need a heavy duty and large capacity washing machine to clean them properly. If you do not have this size washing machine at home, then you can take your down comforter to the laundromat. Attempting to wash a down comforter in a small machine that does not fit is a bad idea.\nWhen washing, wash them in a gentle cycle and use a mild detergent. Also, don\u2019t use a lot of detergents, a small amount is best. Too much detergent might cause the down to strip away. For a down comforter, it is better to rinse it in two cycles to make sure all the soap is rinsed out. For drying purposes, a low capacity dryer is a bad idea. Use a high capacity dryer and put it on low heating so the dryer is gentle on the comforter.\nMake sure the comforter is dried properly otherwise it could lead to a moldy situation with the feathers. While drying, pause the dryer a few times and take the comforter out to give it a fluff. You could get the kids in the house to help with this as they will love it. Unlike skeets and duvet covers, you should wash your down comforters", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 11], [11, 29], [29, 30], [30, 33], [33, 46], [46, 54], [54, 60], [60, 67], [67, 72], [72,

Also, anesthetic (numbing) eye drops are applied to your eye to prevent discomfort.\nIn some cases, you may receive additional medication intravenously during surgery to ensure you remain comfortable, and your cataract surgeon will ask you how you are feeling throughout the procedure.\nMedications used before and during your cataract procedure also might make it hard for you to remember what happened during surgery, even though you are awake the entire time.\nAs your medications wear off after the procedure, you might feel some minor eye discomfort.

Electrons are fired at a bulb coated in phosphors which are excited and emit light. The effect is a \u201cnatural light,\u201d which is the same as a traditional incandescent, Styles said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically old technology that everybody just gave up on some years ago because it\u2019s based on the TV side, not lighting,\u201d he said.\nBecause of the phosphors Vu1 is using, it can better match the light spectrum of incandescent light than competing technologies, Styles said.\nIts first product, which Vu1 intends to start making early next year, is an R30 floodlight for recessed cans which produces as much light as a 65-watt incandescent at 870 lumens while consuming 19 watts. An Energy Star-compliant compact fluorescent light with similar output consumes about 13 watts. But unlike compact fluorescent bulbs, Vu1 bulbs will not have mercury. The cost is projected to be under $20, said Styles.\nAnd now the day has come!\nWell, almost\u2026 Last Friday, ahead of official launch date, Lowe\u2019s started selling the long-awaited Vu1 lamps online (for a lower price than projected, $14.98) but only a few lucky buyers were able to place an order. Yesterday, the Vu1 corporation CEO issued a letter explaining why. It seems Lowe\u2019s need to revamp their website to create a new product category since the Vu1 will not fit into existing lamp categories. Once that\u2019s taken care of, online order should work again.\nEarly reports from those who received their bulbs are mostly positive regarding light quality. (I\u2019ll be back with a review if I can get hold of one myself.) Update: seems that may be several years down the line as they are not yet produced for European mains voltage.\nUpdate Aug 2012: The Vu1 lamp has received much positive attention but the company seems to still have problems delivering the lamps to U.S. retail stores, so eager consumers have to be very patient.", "timestamp": 1556207765000, "doc_text": "After CFL and LEDs, now a completely new lamp technology from an independent company is finally about to enter the market!\nVu1 (pronounced \u201cView one\u201d) today said that it received UL certification for its first lightbulb which it says matches the light quality of incandescent bulbs but uses a", "token_ids_start_true": [1507, 63136, 1265, 32321, 1005, 1380, 86849, 10961, 1661, 1283, 10239, 1574, 39476, 1329, 26046, 1663, 1456, 4, 57679, 1333, 1264, 1006, 79834, 1344, 4661, 1331, 1300, 1007, 1463, 3338, 1291, 2154, 40436, 6016, 1273, 10776, 1679, 90336, 1301, 29747, 4190, 10443, 17334, 75877, 23273, 1289, 18679], "token_texts_start_true": ["\u2581After", "\u2581CFL", "\u2581and", "\u2581LEDs", ",", "\u2581now", "\u2581a\u2581completely\u2581new", "\u2581lamp", "\u2581technology", "\u2581from", "\u2581an\u2581independent", "\u2581company", "\u2581is\u2581finally", "\u2581about", "\u2581to\u2581enter\u2581the", "\u2581market", "!", "<|newline|>", "\u2581Vu", "1", "\u2581", "(", "pronounced", "\u2581\u201c", "View", "\u2581one", "\u201d", ")", "\u2581today", "\u2581said\u2581that", "\u2581it", "\u2581received", "\u2581UL", "\u2581certification", "\u2581for", "\u2581its\u2581first", "\u2581light", "bulb", "\u2581which", "\u2581it\u2581says", "\u2581matches", "\u2581the\u2581light", "\u2581quality\u2581of", "\u2581incandescent", "\u2581bulbs", "\u2581but", "\u2581uses\u2581a"], "token_ids_start_false": [24149, 63136, 1265, 32321, 1005, 1380, 86849, 10961, 1661, 1283, 10239, 1574, 39476, 1329, 26046, 1663, 1456, 4, 57679, 1333, 1264, 1006, 79834, 1344, 4661, 1331, 1300, 1007, 1463, 3338, 1291, 2154, 40436, 6016, 1273, 10776, 1679, 90336, 1301, 29747, 4190, 10443, 17334, 75877, 23273, 1289, 18679], "decoded_text_from_start_true": "After CFL and LEDs, now a completely new lamp technology from an independent company is finally about to enter the market!\nVu1 (pronounced \u201cView one\u201d) today said that it received UL certification for its first lightbulb which it says matches the light quality of incandescent bulbs but uses a", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 5], [5, 9], [9, 13], [13, 18], [18, 19], [19, 23], [23, 40], [40, 45], [45, 56], [56, 61], [61, 76], [76, 84], [84, 95], [95, 101], [101, 114], [114, 121], [121, 122], [122, 123], [123, 125], [125, 126], [126, 127], [127, 128], [128, 138], [138, 140], [140, 144], [144, 148], [148, 149], [149, 150], [150, 156], [156, 166], [166, 169], [169, 178], [178, 181], [181, 195], [195, 199], [199, 209], [209, 215], [215, 219], [219, 225], [225, 233], [233, 241], [241, 251], [251, 262], [262, 275], [275, 281], [281, 285], [285, 292]]}

Times are tough in 1895 and the trio pull stakes to work in a lumber camp, mom and granny helping with meals, and Stan to hit himself in the head with axes, make up imaginary vile pasts for all of the lumberjacks courting his mom, and try to avoid all the diseases his (definitely evil) cousin Geri insists he has on a rotating basis.\nLife as an almost-lumberjack is hard on eleven year old Stanley, so he imagines a life where his father writes him letters from his varied life as a cowboy/hero/outlaw, all of them painstakingly kept in Stanley\u2019s scrapbook, featuring ads from the newspaper \u2013 augmented by Stanley\u2019s own thoughts on the products and how the people in his life might benefit from them.\nAll Stan wants to do is prove to his mom that she doesn\u2019t need a man in her life, because he already is one.

All we\u2019ve done is replicate the fads of our forefathers, only this time, we have the benefit of the Internet to make them spread faster and on a wider scale.\nPhotographing felines in ridiculous outfits and placing even more ridiculous captions on said pictures goes back to Victorian times, to the studios of Harry Pointer and Harry Frees. These photographers separately took photos of cats and other animals in human-like poses and sold them for postcards and children\u2019s books. It was hard work, as the photographers had to make do with primitive equipment while also keeping the live animals still long enough for the perfect pose.\nOne of their contemporaries, taxidermist Walter Potter, had no such difficulties. During his career, Potter mounted countless dead small animals, including rats, cats, and rabbits in poses just like miniature humans.\nTheir bizarre work still could not compare to the eccentric artwork of the painter Louis Wain. Wain reportedly suffered from schizophrenia throughout his life, which would explain why he painted almost nothing but anthropomorphic cats.\nAt some point, we may have all encountered that smug smiling face of Alfred E.

These stereotypes were usually drawn with monkey faces, a common feature that would evolve into Neuman\u2019s \u201cgrinning idiot\u201d face.\nThe \u201cWhat, Me Worry\u201d caption was added to this character in 1911 through the racially charged book Wurra-Wurra: A Legend of St. Patrick at Tara. The book depicted Irishmen as worrywarts who liked to pray constantly to their god Wurra-Wurra (the word sounding like a Gaelic prayer to the Virgin Mary).\nLOLspeak, the ever-addicting error-filled language of the Internet era, has a predecessor in the form of comical abbreviations. This trend among newspapers in the 1830s and \u201940s first started in Boston and made its way to other publications across the country. Comical abbreviations shortened words that were also deliberately misspelled (\u201cnuff said\u201d became \u201cNS\u201d). In place of good, clean fun, however, newspapers wrote the abbreviations mainly to mock poor people and their illiteracy.\nPicture the typical keyboard warrior, all bundled up in a nice, comfy chair but talking smack like an action hero. That\u2019s exactly what the ancient Greeks and Romans did in their time, except that they scribbled their posts on walls and virtually any other surface they could find. With the trash-talking also came regular posts about an individual\u2019s sexual exploits (and his rival\u2019s lack thereof), although plenty of messages also covered heavy topics such as love and philosophy.\nAside from the mundane trolling and exaggerated posting, evidence says that messages were well regulated, especially on walls found in the homes of the wealthy. Just like a forum moderator, the owner controlled who could post a message on his wall. This setup gave him leverage over political candidates who generally favored the walls of the wealthy but would have to first ask permission before posting campaign advertisements.\nPredictions about the end of the world are a dime a dozen throughout different civilizations and timelines. The Toledo Letter, however, was the first documented case of an end-of-the-world scare truly going viral.\nSpread around Europe in 1184 and supposedly written by monks, the letter predicted that the apocalypse would happen in September 1186, the event being preceded by the ominous aligning of the planets \u201cin the sign of the Scales and in the tail of the Dragon.\u201d After that, various natural disasters would commence, and the only way for people to survive would be to flee to the mountains.\nThe letter caused massive panic throughout the continent, with even the Archbishop of Canterbury announcing a 72-hour fast to avert the doomsday prediction. Although the planets did align as predicted, the disaster never happened. Still, we all know that one doomsday prediction failure can never stop the proliferation of countless others.\nThe phrase \u201cflash mob\u201d entered the popular lexicon in 2003 with the first known attempt in Manhattan, New York. Its real meaning, however\u2014which is undisputedly raunchier\u2014goes further back in time to another continent, specifically to when Australia was still largely a penal colony in the 19th century.\nA group of women convicts in Hobart Town, Tasmania flashed their derrieres at a certain Reverend William Bedford while he held a service for them inside the prison, ostensibly protesting his insincerity and their deplorable working conditions. Due to their overwhelming numbers, authorities failed to find and punish the ringleaders. However, not all found the event insulting. The governor\u2019s wife, who was also attending the service, had to struggle to control herself before making it back to her carriage, at which point she burst out laughing.\nAnyone with an email address or social networking account is bound to get a chain letter. Far from being a child of the Internet age, however, this annoying trend began as early as the late 19th century. The first known example was a solicitation letter with the signature of a \u201cMrs. George O. Haman\u201d of Sherwood, Tennessee. The letter appealed to kind souls to donate 10 cents so that she could fund the education of impoverished white children in Appalachia.\nThe letter contained her address and instructions for it to be duplicated and sent to four other people. In contrast to chain mails of today, the letter promised to bless the compliant receiver rather than curse those who ignore it. The use of threats became more prevalent especially during the Depression era.\nWe might think that people\u2019s never-ending obsession of taking pictures of themselves began with the digital age and reflects a new level of narcissism. According to one researcher, however, the art of taking selfies could actually be attributed to the mirror fad that hit the medieval era.\nArt historian James Hall says that people\u2019s fascination with mirrors provided the spark later on for self-portraits done by artists starting in the 12th century. The only difference is that those self-portraits were actually a means of self-reflection in accordance with Christian teachings of that era and not just another way of getting attention.\nHall cites Jan van Eyck\u2019s \u201cArnolfini Portrait\u201d and postulates that the painting\u2019s mirrors represent a guide to knowing oneself better. These self-portraits enabled subjects to contemplate and criticize their innermost selves. The trend of \u201cselfless\u201d self-portraits gradually faded out by the 20th century, giving us the shallow selfies of today.\nMade famous by the spine-chilling graphic novel and movie V For Vendetta and its subsequent use by protest and activist groups worldwide, the iconic Guy Fawkes mask\u2019s forerunner was created shortly after its namesake\u2019s execution, following the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Every November 5\u2014the anniversary of the failed rebellion\u2014people in Britain held a \u201cGuy Fawkes Night,\u201d in which they burned an effigy wearing a likeness of the man\u2019s face.\nLater on, people actually wore Guy Fawkes masks in the 18th century. During that time, little children wore crude versions of the mask while begging on the streets. Some would even go further and completely dress themselves for the occasion by blackening their faces and wearing old, black clothing. To complete the look, they would also repeatedly recite the famous \u201cRemember the fifth of November\u201d chant out on the street.\nThe lack of an Internet connection did not impede 19th-century rabid fanboys and fangirls from fixating on their idol, which at the time happened to be Sherlock Holmes. A devoted following of the famous detective during the Victorian era spearheaded the beginning of modern fandom.\nThese fans acted every bit as obsessive as their modern counterparts. So when author Conan Doyle\u2014who didn\u2019t care much for Holmes\u2014killed off the detective in his fight with Professor Moriarty, fans were outraged. Many protested the death by walking on the streets wearing black armbands. One woman even allegedly hit Doyle with an umbrella.\nThe protests reached as far as America, where fans petitioned Doyle \u201cto keep Holmes alive.\u201d An exasperated Doyle had to relent and write a new story saying that Holmes did survive the confrontation, to the joyous glee of fans everywhere.", "timestamp": 1556178340000, "doc_text": "Memes and trends on the Internet appear to be a product of the digital age, created out of randomness and doomed to quickly die out once we soon tire of them.

The Toledo Letter, however, was the first documented case of an end-of-the-world scare truly going viral.\nSpread around Europe in 1184 and supposedly written by monks, the letter predicted that the apocalypse would happen in September 1186, the event being preceded by the ominous aligning of the planets \u201cin the sign of the Scales and in the tail of the Dragon.\u201d After that, various natural disasters would commence, and the only way for people to survive would be to flee to the mountains.\nThe letter caused massive panic throughout the continent, with even the Archbishop of Canterbury announcing a 72-hour fast to avert the doomsday prediction. Although the planets did align as predicted, the disaster never happened. Still, we all know that one doomsday prediction failure can never stop the proliferation of countless others.\nThe phrase \u201cflash mob\u201d entered the popular lexicon in 2003 with the first known attempt in Manhattan, New York. Its real meaning, however\u2014which is undisputedly raunchier\u2014goes further back in time to another continent, specifically to when Australia was still largely a penal colony in the 19th century.\nA group of women convicts in Hobart Town, Tasmania flashed their derrieres at a certain Reverend William Bedford while he held a service for them inside the prison, ostensibly protesting his insincerity and their deplorable working conditions. Due to their overwhelming numbers, authorities failed to find and punish the ringleaders. However, not all found the event insulting. The governor\u2019s wife, who was also attending the service, had to struggle to control herself before making it back to her carriage, at which point she burst out laughing.\nAnyone with an email address or social networking account is bound to get a chain letter. Far from being a child of the Internet age, however, this annoying trend began as early as the late 19th century. The first known example was a solicitation letter with the signature of a \u201cMrs. George O. Haman\u201d of Sherwood, Tennessee. The letter appealed to kind souls to donate 10 cents so that she could fund the education of impoverished white children in Appalachia.\nThe letter contained her address and instructions for it to be duplicated and sent to four other people. In contrast to chain mails of today, the letter promised to bless the compliant receiver rather than curse those who ignore it. The use of threats became more prevalent especially during the Depression era.\nWe might think that people\u2019s never-ending obsession of taking pictures of themselves began with the digital age and reflects a new level of narcissism. According to one researcher, however, the art of taking selfies could actually be attributed to the mirror fad that hit the medieval era.\nArt historian James Hall says that people\u2019s fascination with mirrors provided the spark later on for self-portraits done by artists starting in the 12th century. The only difference is that those self-portraits were actually a means of self-reflection in accordance with Christian teachings of that era and not just another way of getting attention.\nHall cites Jan van Eyck\u2019s \u201cArnolfini Portrait\u201d and postulates that the painting\u2019s mirrors represent a guide to knowing oneself better. These self-portraits enabled subjects to contemplate and criticize their innermost selves. The trend of \u201cselfless\u201d self-portraits gradually faded out by the 20th century, giving us the shallow selfies of today.\nMade famous by the spine-chilling graphic novel and movie V For Vendetta and its subsequent use by protest and activist groups worldwide, the iconic Guy Fawkes mask\u2019s forerunner was created shortly after its namesake\u2019s execution, following the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Every November 5\u2014the anniversary of the failed rebellion\u2014people in Britain held a \u201cGuy Fawkes Night,\u201d", "token_ids_start_true": [130227, 1395, 6110, 16211, 13501, 78387, 132492,

and trends on the Internet appear to be a product of the digital age, created out of randomness and doomed to quickly die out once we soon tire of them. In reality, many have origins dating back hundreds of years. All we\u2019ve done is replicate the fads of our forefathers, only this time, we have the benefit of the Internet to make them spread faster and on a wider scale.\nPhotographing felines in ridiculous outfits and placing even more ridiculous captions on said pictures goes back to Victorian times, to the studios of Harry Pointer and Harry Frees. These photographers separately took photos of cats and other animals in human-like poses and sold them for postcards and children\u2019s books. It was hard work, as the photographers had to make do with primitive equipment while also keeping the live animals still long enough for the perfect pose.\nOne of their contemporaries, taxidermist Walter Potter, had no such difficulties. During his career, Potter mounted countless dead small animals, including rats, cats, and rabbits in poses just like miniature humans.\nTheir bizarre work still could not compare to the eccentric artwork of the painter Louis Wain. Wain reportedly suffered from schizophrenia throughout his life, which would explain why he painted almost nothing but anthropomorphic cats.\nAt some point, we may have all encountered that smug smiling face of Alfred E. Neuman coupled with the usual caption of \u201cWhat, Me Worry?\u201d Although named and made famous by Mad Magazine in the 1950s, the figure\u2019s roots are steeped in racism against the Irish during their mass migration to the US in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nDuring that time, the Irish were depicted though a variety of stereotypes, such as violent drunks, low-brow hooligans, and secret agents of their country or the Pope. These stereotypes were usually drawn with monkey faces, a common feature that would evolve into Neuman\u2019s \u201cgrinning idiot\u201d face.\nThe \u201cWhat, Me Worry\u201d caption was added to this character in 1911 through the racially charged book Wurra-Wurra: A Legend of St. Patrick at Tara. The book depicted Irishmen as worrywarts who liked to pray constantly to their god Wurra-Wurra (the word sounding like a Gaelic prayer to the Virgin Mary).\nLOLspeak, the ever-addicting error-filled language of the Internet era, has a predecessor in the form of comical abbreviations. This trend among newspapers in the 1830s and \u201940s first started in Boston and made its way to other publications across the country. Comical abbreviations shortened words that were also deliberately misspelled (\u201cnuff said\u201d became \u201cNS\u201d). In place of good, clean fun, however, newspapers wrote the abbreviations mainly to mock poor people and their illiteracy.\nPicture the typical keyboard warrior, all bundled up in a nice, comfy chair but talking smack like an action hero. That\u2019s exactly what the ancient Greeks and Romans did in their time, except that they scribbled their posts on walls and virtually any other surface they could find. With the trash-talking also came regular posts about an individual\u2019s sexual exploits (and his rival\u2019s lack thereof), although plenty of messages also covered heavy topics such as love and philosophy.\nAside from the mundane trolling and exaggerated posting, evidence says that messages were well regulated, especially on walls found in the homes of the wealthy. Just like a forum moderator, the owner controlled who could post a message on his wall. This setup gave him leverage over political candidates who generally favored the walls of the wealthy but would have to first ask permission before posting campaign advertisements.\nPredictions about the end of the world are a dime a dozen throughout different civilizations and timelines. The Toledo Letter, however, was the first documented case of an end-of-the-world scare truly going viral.\nSpread around Europe in 1184 and supposedly written by monks, the letter predicted that the apocalypse would happen in September 1186, the event being preceded by the ominous aligning of the planets \u201cin the sign of the Scales and in the tail of the Dragon.\u201d After that, various natural disasters would commence, and the only way for people to survive would be to flee to the mountains.\nThe letter caused massive panic throughout the continent, with even the Archbishop of Canterbury announcing a 72-hour fast to avert the doomsday prediction. Although the planets did align as predicted, the disaster never happened. Still, we all know that one doomsday prediction failure can never stop the proliferation of countless others.\nThe phrase \u201cflash mob\u201d entered the popular lexicon in 2003 with the first known attempt in Manhattan, New York. Its real meaning, however\u2014which is undisputedly raunchier\u2014goes further back in time to another continent, specifically to when Australia was still largely a penal colony in the 19th century.\nA group of women convicts in Hobart Town, Tasmania flashed their derrieres at a certain Reverend William Bedford while he held a service for them inside the prison, ostensibly protesting his insincerity and their deplorable working conditions. Due to their overwhelming numbers, authorities failed to find and punish the ringleaders. However, not all found the event insulting. The governor\u2019s wife, who was also attending the service, had to struggle to control herself before making it back to her carriage, at which point she burst out laughing.\nAnyone with an email address or social networking account is bound to get a chain letter. Far from being a child of the Internet age, however, this annoying trend began as early as the late 19th century. The first known example was a solicitation letter with the signature of a \u201cMrs. George O. Haman\u201d of Sherwood, Tennessee. The letter appealed to kind souls to donate 10 cents so that she could fund the education of impoverished white children in Appalachia.\nThe letter contained her address and instructions for it to be duplicated and sent to four other people. In contrast to chain mails of today, the letter promised to bless the compliant receiver rather than curse those who ignore it. The use of threats became more prevalent especially during the Depression era.\nWe might think that people\u2019s never-ending obsession of taking pictures of themselves began with the digital age and reflects a new level of narcissism. According to one researcher, however, the art of taking selfies could actually be attributed to the mirror fad that hit the medieval era.\nArt historian James Hall says that people\u2019s fascination with mirrors provided the spark later on for self-portraits done by artists starting in the 12th century. The only difference is that those self-portraits were actually a means of self-reflection in accordance with Christian teachings of that era and not just another way of getting attention.\nHall cites Jan van Eyck\u2019s \u201cArnolfini Portrait\u201d and postulates that the painting\u2019s mirrors represent a guide to knowing oneself better. These self-portraits enabled subjects to contemplate and criticize their innermost selves. The trend of \u201cselfless\u201d self-portraits gradually faded out by the 20th century, giving us the shallow selfies of today.\nMade famous by the spine-chilling graphic novel and movie V For Vendetta and its subsequent use by protest and activist groups worldwide, the iconic Guy Fawkes mask\u2019s forerunner was created shortly after its namesake\u2019s execution, following the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Every November 5\u2014the anniversary of the failed rebellion\u2014people in Britain held a \u201cGuy Fawkes Night,\u201d", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 4], [4, 9], [9, 16], [16, 32], [32,

{"url": "https://rebecca-milton.com/2018/08/20/money-my-nemesis/", "text": "Growing up, I was fortunate to live in a family where whilst we weren\u2019t profuse with money, we also didn\u2019t generally struggle to eat. There were periods that were harder, as with all households, but mostly we were comfortable. We didn\u2019t go on holidays or do many extravagant things, but we had a huge house with an even bigger garden.\nThen I got to university, and I spent a couple of years very manic. Those years completely obliterated me financially. I defaulted on several bank accounts and credit cards, after chewing through the entirety of my student loans by drinking too much and eating a frankly obscene amount of curly fries from the university bar.\nThe years after that, I tried to stay living in the same city, but the finality of my mental breakdown meant that I was living on benefits. And I was appealing those benefits, so I was on the minimum amount you can get paid whilst waiting for a result.\nI learned different lessons about money in those years; how to make a meal that cost 50 pence. How to feel guilty about every single purchase. Most of all, how to struggle with accepting help.\nYou see, I don\u2019t talk about money.\nIt\u2019s what we did growing up, and it\u2019s what I continued to do in adulthood, even in the years where I was obliterating my credit. The first time I had to talk about it was when I was defaulting, and even then I talked only to my mum and my financial advisor \u2013 no one else. My mum made all of the phone calls for me, because I couldn\u2019t do it myself.\nAnd I kept on that way, not talking about it, going quiet whenever any of my friends \u2013 who were all working in \u2018real jobs\u2019, earning money in amounts that I could barely imagine \u2013 would mention money. It\u2019s worth noting that to me, an amount that I could barely imagine? Was minimum wage. The idea of earning that much overwhelmed me.\nBut in those years, I also had to learn to handle money properly again. Because I wasn\u2019t allowed an overdraft or a credit card anymore, and so the benefits I got were all that I had. And I did learn, quickly and well, getting to a point where I could live acceptably within my means most of the time. If I wanted or needed something bigger, I\u2019d find a way to earn cash for it, through housesitting or similar.\nBut I still wasn\u2019t actually talking about it.\nI\u2019m far from the only person who does this, I know that. I\u2019m sure many people have to work through a childhood of never talking about money and turn that into a functional adulthood. That\u2019s partly why I\u2019m writing this \u2013 to call out to those of you who have had this same experience and say \u2018hey, me too!\u2019.\nSo fast forward a few years. I\u2019m okayish with money now, though it still terrifies me, and I can\u2019t spend more than \u00a310 on basically anything without wanting to vomit. My partner and I are living together, actually in our own place rather than with family. For two years, we live together without talking about money much at all.\nWe do sometimes, when it\u2019s absolutely necessary. But mostly, I pay for the food out of my benefits, and he pays for all the other things. The things I don\u2019t want to see, because the numbers are too scary \u2013 like the rent. I have a vague notion of how much this is, and the council tax, and the energy bills, and so forth. But he valiantly protects me from the numbers that terrify me.\nBecause we\u2019re actually pretty comfortable now. We can have meals that cost more than 50 pence a portion. We can afford to go to places, and eat out, and do other things that make me horrified. (You want to get takeaway? ONE TAKEAWAY COSTS AS MUCH AS OUR ENTIRE WEEKLY FOOD BUDGET!).\nOnly I can\u2019t, because I\u2019m too afraid of the numbers involved. Every time my meagre income doesn\u2019t cover things, I have to ask him to send me money. Every time I have to do that, I agonise over it for hours and often have panic attacks. It\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m terrible with money.\nSo another couple of years onwards, we now own a house. We have a car, we have expensive computers that we took out on a loan, and I\u2019m still sitting here with my \u00a3350/month benefits income paying for the food shopping and a few bills and not much else. When we need to make a bigger purchase (one over \u00a310), I literally walk away from the checkout and leave my partner paying so I don\u2019t hear the total. Sometimes I don\u2019t walk away fast enough, and I feel sick for the rest of the day.\nBut we have to make decisions as a couple about things we want to do or not do. My non-involvement\u2026isn\u2019t really tenable. So this past weekend, I faced the thing that has terrified me in the background, constantly, for years. I looked at our budget. At the giant numbers \u2013 the budget has our mortgage in (not a small number), our car loan (also not small), our computers (of which mine was a gift so I never knew how much it cost before).\nI spent an hour crying whilst learning to understand the budget.\nMy partner, patient as ever, held my hand and took me through how it all works. He \u2013 now we \u2013 uses You Need a Budget, which I would definitely recommend because its UI is lovely. I just wouldn\u2019t recommend connecting it to accounts (which you can\u2019t do outside the US anyway), because it\u2019s not incredibly secure.\nAll of it makes sense, and I can see how it\u2019s going to help me better imagine our money. How it could help me learn that spending money is not evil, and that we are in fact in a very comfortable and privileged place, even having only one proper income. I just have to stop thinking of our income as my paltry sum, and instead as what we earn together. So nothing big, right?\nAn hour later we\u2019ve gone through it all, and I feel like I\u2019ve run a marathon, but I\u2019ve done it. There\u2019s nothing else to do until the next time I spend or earn money, so I close it and put it aside until payday, the next financial event.\nThen the next day, I have a panic attack.\nIt\u2019s not a bad one. As I\u2019ve gotten better at identifying and dealing with panic attacks, they\u2019ve gotten a lot less explosive. I have quiet panic attacks now, the kind you can have without bothering anyone else. Without anyone else noticing. The awfulness inherent in that is a whole other post worth of stuff, but for now let\u2019s just say that I had such a panic attack.\nI couldn\u2019t work out why, though. I had been talking about how we needed to buy new bins for the kitchen, and how I could move money around to do it. But a panic attack based on that seemed out of the blue even for me. Then I remembered the budget, and the numbers, and suddenly it all made sense.\nBecause when you\u2019re facing as pervasive and overwhelming a fear as this, it isn\u2019t just scary in the moment. It\u2019s scary theoretically in the space around those moments. And I know that in order to get rid of the stress that finances cause me, I\u2019ve got to face down a lot more stress first.\nBut I\u2019ve started \u2013 and that\u2019s the most important thing.\nThank you so much for reading!

"Growing up, I was fortunate to live in a family where whilst we weren\u2019t profuse with money, we also didn\u2019t generally struggle to eat. There were periods that were harder, as with all households, but mostly we were comfortable. We didn\u2019t go on holidays or do many extravagant things, but we had a huge house with an even bigger garden.\nThen I got to university, and I spent a couple of years very manic. Those years completely obliterated me financially. I defaulted on several bank accounts and credit cards, after chewing through the entirety of my student loans by drinking too much and eating a frankly obscene amount of curly fries from the university bar.\nThe years after that, I tried to stay living in the same city, but the finality of my mental breakdown meant that I was living on benefits. And I was appealing those benefits, so I was on the minimum amount you can get paid whilst waiting for a result.\nI learned different lessons about money in those years; how to make a meal that cost 50 pence. How to feel guilty about every single purchase. Most of all, how to struggle with accepting help.\nYou see, I don\u2019t talk about money.\nIt\u2019s what we did growing up, and it\u2019s what I continued to do in adulthood, even in the years where I was obliterating my credit. The first time I had to talk about it was when I was defaulting, and even then I talked only to my mum and my financial advisor \u2013 no one else. My mum made all of the phone calls for me, because I couldn\u2019t do it myself.\nAnd I kept on that way, not talking about it, going quiet whenever any of my friends \u2013 who were all working in \u2018real jobs\u2019, earning money in amounts that I could barely imagine \u2013 would mention money. It\u2019s worth noting that to me, an amount that I could barely imagine? Was minimum wage. The idea of earning that much overwhelmed me.\nBut in those years, I also had to learn to handle money properly again. Because I wasn\u2019t allowed an overdraft or a credit card anymore, and so the benefits I got were all that I", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 10], [10, 11], [11, 17], [17, 27], [27, 40], [40, 47], [47, 53], [53, 60], [60, 71], [71, 75], [75, 79], [79, 90], [90, 91], [91, 99], [99, 106], [106, 116], [116, 125], [125, 132], [132, 133], [133, 144], [144, 151], [151, 162], [162, 169], [169, 170], [170, 173], [173, 182], [182, 193], [193, 194], [194, 205], [205, 213], [213, 225], [225, 226], [226, 236], [236, 242], [242, 251], [251, 257], [257, 262], [262, 274], [274, 281], [281, 282], [282, 293], [293, 300], [300, 311], [311, 326], [326, 333], [333, 334], [334, 335], [335, 339], [339, 348], [348, 359], [359, 360], [360, 364], [364, 372], [372, 390], [390, 395], [395, 401], [401, 402], [402, 408], [408, 414], [414, 425], [425, 437], [437, 440], [440, 452], [452, 453], [453, 455], [455, 465], [465, 476], [476, 490], [490, 494], [494, 507], [507, 508], [508, 514], [514, 522], [522, 530], [530, 546], [546, 549], [549, 563], [563, 566], [566, 575], [575, 584], [584, 595], [595, 597], [597, 605], [605, 613], [613, 623], [623, 629], [629, 635], [635, 644], [644, 655], [655, 659], [659, 660], [660, 661], [661, 664], [664, 676], [676, 681], [681, 682], [682, 690], [690, 698], [698, 708], [708, 717], [717, 722], [722, 723], [723, 731], [731, 740], [740, 746], [746, 753], [753, 763], [763, 774], [774, 780], [780, 790], [790, 799], [799, 800], [800, 804], [804, 810], [810, 820], [820, 826], [826, 835], [835, 836], [836, 845], [845, 852], [852, 867], [867, 879], [879, 884], [884, 891], [891, 905], [905, 906], [906, 913], [913, 914], [914, 923], [923, 933], [933, 941], [941, 953], [953, 956], [956, 968], [968, 969], [969, 983], [983, 988], [988, 998], [998, 999], [999, 1001], [1001, 1002], [1002, 1007], [1007, 1008], [1008, 1015], [1015, 1033], [1033, 1046], [1046, 1055], [1055, 1056], [1056, 1068], [1068, 1069], [1069, 1076], [1076, 1090], [1090, 1100], [1100, 1105], [1105, 1106], [1106, 1107], [1107, 1114], [1114, 1115], [1115, 1123], [1123, 1134], [1134, 1140], [1140, 1141], [1141, 1142], [1142, 1144], [1144, 1146], [1146, 1158], [1158, 1169], [1169, 1170], [1170, 1177], [1177, 1179], [1179, 1184], [1184, 1199], [1199, 1202], [1202, 1205], [1205, 1215], [1215, 1216], [1216, 1221], [1221, 1234], [1234, 1246], [1246, 1247], [1247, 1250], [1250, 1259], [1259, 1262], [1262, 1269], [1269, 1270], [1270, 1287], [1287, 1291], [1291, 1305], [1305, 1312], [1312, 1323], [1323, 1334], [1334, 1335], [1335, 1349], [1349, 1351], [1351, 1358], [1358, 1366], [1366, 1373], [1373, 1380], [1380, 1398], [1398, 1400], [1400, 1412], [1412, 1413], [1413, 1420], [1420, 1425], [1425, 1436], [1436, 1448], [1448, 1455], [1455, 1456], [1456, 1464], [1464, 1475], [1475, 1481], [1481, 1488], [1488, 1489], [1489, 1490], [1490, 1495], [1495, 1503], [1503, 1512], [1512, 1513], [1513, 1517], [1517, 1534], [1534, 1535], [1535, 1541], [1541, 1547], [1547, 1556], [1556, 1560], [1560, 1574], [1574, 1576], [1576, 1585], [1585, 1589], [1589, 1600], [1600, 1602], [1602, 1606], [1606, 1611], [1611, 1612], [1612, 1613], [1613, 1627], [1627, 1630], [1630, 1638], [1638, 1651], [1651, 1658], [1658, 1666], [1666, 1668], [1668, 1674], [1674, 1682], [1682, 1688], [1688, 1689], [1689, 1692], [1692, 1694], [1694, 1707], [1707, 1712], [1712, 1718], [1718, 1719], [1719, 1729], [1729, 1742], [1742, 1749], [1749, 1757], [1757, 1758], [1758, 1762], [1762, 1775], [1775, 1776], [1776, 1788], [1788, 1796], [1796, 1806], [1806, 1818], [1818, 1821], [1821, 1822], [1822, 1823], [1823, 1829], [1829, 1841], [1841, 1842], [1842, 1853], [1853, 1862], [1862, 1872], [1872, 1878], [1878, 1887], [1887, 1893], [1893, 1894], [1894, 1902], [1902, 1911], [1911, 1919], [1919, 1922], [1922, 1932], [1932, 1935], [1935, 1949], [1949, 1957], [1957, 1958], [1958, 1965], [1965, 1978], [1978, 1984], [1984, 1993], [1993, 2000]]}

A low disturbance repair using Rotafix manufactured timber replacement units being bonded into place using Rotafix Structural Adhesive removes the need to take the roof covering off the castle.\nClyne Castle is a grade II listed building situated on a hill overlooking Swansea Bay, near Blackpill, Swansea. It was originally built in 1791 by Richard Phillips.\nIt is a two-storey castellated mansion, built of randomly laid local sandstone with Forest of Dean stone dressings situated on the outskirts of Swansea.\nThe Castle with its many annexes has a complex roof structure made from slate. These annex roof structures drain into the interconnected valley drainage system formed from lead sheeting.\nThe failure of the valley drainage system has resulted in a prolonged exposure of parts of the roof structure to sustained water ingress leading to wet rot in the underlying span beams, hip rafters and ceiling joists. The suspended ornate lath and plaster ceiling has suffered localised damage but is a period feature that must be retained.\nProtectahome, approved Rotafix contractors, were subcontracted by RM Williams to undertake the specialist repairs required to restore this beautiful building to its original glory with minimal disruption to the integrity of the existing building features.\nProtectahome, in conjunction with Rotafix and Ian Jones Associates, Structural Engineering Consultants, developed a series of low disturbance repairs to the roof timber members using Rotafix Structural Adhesive, (RSA), Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) rods, and KERTO structural engineered timber sections to replace in situ the timbers that had been ravaged by the ingress of moisture over time.\nThe hip beams supporting the roof were badly damaged at the wall plate and bearing ends. Once the structure was supported it was possible to remove the damaged and decayed timber.\nMeasurements were then taken and an oversize KERTO replacement prepared off site. The Rotafix Timber Resin Splice (TRS) side slot design was chosen as the preferred method of joining the original and replacement timbers as access was limited.\nStructural calculations showed that 6 number 16 mm diameter high tensile rebar connections would be required to meet the requirements of the design.\nOnce the Rotafix TRS section was on site the experienced craftsmen of Protectahome cut and fitted the new timber to the exact requirements. The slots in the KERTO and existing parent timber were then injection filled with the RSA.\nThe span beams were repaired by removing the damaged timber. Holes were then drilled up into the ends of the parent timbers to allow high tensile strength 20mm rebar rods to be bonded in place. New sections of KERTO were made to measure that featured 6 side slots to receive the protruding 20mm diameter rods. The slots in the timber were filled with RSA. KERTO engineered timber was used to give guaranteed strength consistency to the joist repair.\nBonded in rods were also used to repair joists in the ceiling. In this instance it was possible to achieve the design specification using 12mm GFRP rods and replacement grade C24 softwood timber .\nOnce the ceiling joists had been repaired the lath and plaster restoration work commenced in the knowledge that the roof structure was rigid and sound.", "timestamp": 1555662149000, "doc_text": "This case study shows an example of joists being repaired without removing the roof covering.

case study shows an example of joists being repaired without removing the roof covering. A low disturbance repair using Rotafix manufactured timber replacement units being bonded into place using Rotafix Structural Adhesive removes the need to take the roof covering off the castle.\nClyne Castle is a grade II listed building situated on a hill overlooking Swansea Bay, near Blackpill, Swansea. It was originally built in 1791 by Richard Phillips.\nIt is a two-storey castellated mansion, built of randomly laid local sandstone with Forest of Dean stone dressings situated on the outskirts of Swansea.\nThe Castle with its many annexes has a complex roof structure made from slate. These annex roof structures drain into the interconnected valley drainage system formed from lead sheeting.\nThe failure of the valley drainage system has resulted in a prolonged exposure of parts of the roof structure to sustained water ingress leading to wet rot in the underlying span beams, hip rafters and ceiling joists. The suspended ornate lath and plaster ceiling has suffered localised damage but is a period feature that must be retained.\nProtectahome, approved Rotafix contractors, were subcontracted by RM Williams to undertake the specialist repairs required to restore this beautiful building to its original glory with minimal disruption to the integrity of the existing building features.\nProtectahome, in conjunction with Rotafix and Ian Jones Associates, Structural Engineering Consultants, developed a series of low disturbance repairs to the roof timber members using Rotafix Structural Adhesive, (RSA), Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) rods, and KERTO structural engineered timber sections to replace in situ the timbers that had been ravaged by the ingress of moisture over time.\nThe hip beams supporting the roof were badly damaged at the wall plate and bearing ends. Once the structure was supported it was possible to remove the damaged and decayed timber.\nMeasurements were then taken and an oversize KERTO replacement prepared off site. The Rotafix Timber Resin Splice (TRS) side slot design was chosen as the preferred method of joining the original and replacement timbers as access was limited.\nStructural calculations showed that 6 number 16 mm diameter high tensile rebar connections would be required to meet the requirements of the design.\nOnce the Rotafix TRS section was on site the experienced craftsmen of Protectahome cut and fitted the new timber to the exact requirements. The slots in the KERTO and existing parent timber were then injection filled with the RSA.\nThe span beams were repaired by removing the damaged timber. Holes were then drilled up into the ends of the parent timbers to allow high tensile strength 20mm rebar rods to be bonded in place. New sections of KERTO were made to measure that featured 6 side slots to receive the protruding 20mm diameter rods. The slots in the timber were filled with RSA.

resolution list for many Americans. To help dieters shed pounds and jump start healthier lifestyles, Emory Heart & Vascular Center cardiologist Laurence Sperling, MD, served on a U.S. News & World Report panel appraising some of the country's most popular diets.\nSperling, an annual panelist since the rankings began in 2011, worked with a group of top U.S. physicians, nutritionists, dietary consultants and other experts to assess and rank 38 diets. A full list can be found here.\n\"The top ranking diets are considered easy to follow, nutritious, safe and effective for weight loss and preventing diabetes,\" says Sperling, the founder and director of the Emory Heart Disease Prevention Center. \"The list is a good resource to help guide the process of finding a diet that you can practice and, more importantly, maintain over time as part of a larger, healthier lifestyle.\"\nSperling says healthy, well-proportioned eating, walking or physical activity on most days of the week and keeping an ideal body weight are all integral components of a healthy lifestyle.\nIn addition to the Best Diets Overall, this year's list includes the Best Weight-Loss Diets, Best Fast Weight-Loss Diets, Easiest Diets to Follow, Best Commercial Diets, Best Diets for Healthy Eating,", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 4], [4, 15], [15, 19], [19, 33], [33, 36], [36, 54], [54, 65], [65, 74], [74, 89], [89, 90], [90, 98], [98, 103], [103, 106], [106, 111], [111, 122], [122, 133], [133, 143], [143, 154], [154, 155], [155, 161], [161, 167], [167, 169], [169, 178], [178, 185], [185, 198], [198, 207], [207, 212], [212, 216], [216, 217], [217, 220], [220, 221], [221, 231], [231, 233], [233, 258], [258, 264], [264, 268], [268, 275], [275, 287], [287, 295], [295, 297], [297, 310], [310, 316], [316, 317], [317, 318], [318, 322], [322, 326], [326, 327], [327, 337], [337, 346], [346, 356], [356, 365], [365, 374], [374, 375], [375, 379], [379, 380], [380, 392], [392, 403], [403, 407], [407, 412], [412, 423], [423, 424], [424, 438], [438, 439], [439, 447], [447, 459], [459, 469], [469, 477], [477, 487], [487, 491], [491, 496], [496, 497], [497, 499], [499, 505], [505, 506], [506, 513], [513, 518], [518, 536], [536, 537], [537, 538], [538, 539], [539, 542], [542, 546], [546, 554], [554, 560], [560, 575], [575, 590], [590, 591], [591, 602], [602, 603], [603, 622], [622, 638], [638, 653], [653, 662], [662, 663], [663, 664], [664, 669], [669, 674], [674, 678], [678, 679], [679, 683], [683, 695], [695, 711], [711, 717], [717, 723], [723, 731], [731, 742], [742, 749], [749, 750], [750, 752], [752, 755], [755, 760], [760, 770], [770, 779], [779, 793], [793, 808], [808, 818], [818, 823], [823, 836], [836, 849], [849, 850], [850, 867], [867, 868], [868, 877], [877, 887], [887, 890], [890, 907], [907, 908], [908, 918], [918, 928], [928, 930], [930, 931], [931, 935], [935, 939], [939, 944], [944, 952], [952, 953], [953, 959], [959, 969], [969, 971], [971, 978], [978, 979], [979, 987], [987, 990], [990, 1008], [1008, 1016], [1016, 1033], [1033, 1045], [1045, 1054], [1054, 1066], [1066, 1074], [1074, 1083], [1083, 1097], [1097, 1117], [1117, 1118], [1118, 1119], [1119, 1137], [1137, 1142], [1142, 1147], [1147, 1148], [1148, 1156], [1156, 1157], [1157, 1167], [1167, 1169], [1169, 1183], [1183, 1192], [1192, 1199], [1199, 1200], [1200, 1204], [1204, 1209], [1209, 1210], [1210, 1211], [1211, 1216], [1216, 1221], [1221, 1228], [1228, 1229], [1229, 1233], [1233, 1238], [1238, 1239], [1239, 1240], [1240, 1248], [1248, 1253], [1253, 1257], [1257, 1264], [1264, 1265], [1265, 1270], [1270, 1281], [1281, 1286], [1286, 1287], [1287, 1288], [1288, 1293], [1293, 1298], [1298, 1303], [1303, 1311], [1311, 1318], [1318, 1319]]}

Open all thru-hulls, check your shaft, strut, cutlass bearing, props, intake screens and anodes. Check the hull for blisters, change the gear lube in lower units, and clean and disconnect the batteries. Make sure the batteries are fully charged prior to haul-out and leave them in the boat.\n11.

{"url": "https://austenprose.com/2014/05/05/shamela-naxos-audiobooks-by-henry-fielding-read-by-clare-corbett-a-review/?shared=email&msg=fail", "text": "\u201cIn my last [letter] I left off at our sitting down to Supper on our Wedding Night, where I behaved with as much Bashfulness as the purest Virgin in the World could have done. The most difficult Task for me was to blush; however, by holding my Breath, and squeezing my Cheeks with my Handkerchief, I did pretty well\u201d (297).\nReading Samuel Richardson\u2019s novel Pamela, Or, Virtue Rewarded, as I recounted in my previous review of it, is not for the faint of heart; but I am happy to say that it was all made worthwhile just this past week as I listened to a Naxos AudioBooks recording of Henry Fielding\u2019s masterful parody fittingly entitled Shamela. Many know Fielding for Tom Jones, but his satirical powers are at full and outrageous height in Shamela. In a quarter of the number of pages found in the original story, Fielding highlights and lampoons all of Richardson\u2019s characteristic tropes, transforming Miss Pamela Andrews from a paragon of female virtue into an archetypical scheming hussy. The great irony is that, as shamefully vicious as Shamela maybe, she is a great deal more fun to listen to than her saintly prototype.\nCentral to Richardson\u2019s sentimental plot was Pamela\u2019s virtue. By virtue, readers must understand two things: her honesty and her virginity. Understandably, Pamela insists on protecting these, since they are her only means for attracting a worthy and, hopefully, wealthy suitor. Because these two meanings of virtue are at the heart of the conflict in Pamela, Fielding places them squarely at the heart of his comedic retelling. Shamela, as her name implies, is anything but honest. In her letters to her mother, she makes it plain that her every action toward Squire Booby (Mr. B\u2019s new name) is aimed at provoking the young man\u2019s sexual passion as a means to coerce him into marriage. Accordingly, her protestations against that gentleman\u2019s sexual advances, while they mirror Pamela\u2019s, are all pretense. She would like nothing better than for her employer to seduce her, but not before she secures a share of his fortune for herself. As she tells Mrs. Jervis: \u201c\u2026Fellows have often taken away in the Morning, what they gave over Night. No, Mrs. Jervis, nothing under a regular taking into Keeping, a settled Settlement, for me, and all my Heirs, all my whole Liftetime, shall do the Business\u2013or else crosslegged, is the Word\u2026\u201d (283). Of course, as the quote with which I opened this review indicates, Shamela is no virgin anyway!\nAs you might have guessed, Pamela is not the only character whose personality Fielding changes for comedic effect\u2013all the major characters are the opposite of their originals. Mr. B is a fool, Mr. Williams is a lascivious skamp, Mrs. Jervis is a coconspirator, and, best of all, Pamela\u2019s parents are low-class trash. Indeed, while the original Pamela\u2019s father writes ad nauseum to his daughter about her Christian duty, Shamela\u2019s father is serving time in prison. And Shamela\u2019s mother is little better. Readers are told she \u201csold Oranges in the Play-House,\u201d a not so subtle way to say she was a prostitute (280).\nIn fact, Shamela\u2019s mother\u2013whose regal name, Henrietta Maria Honora Andrews, belies her tawdry lifestyle\u2013steals this story\u2019s spotlight, for it was her corrupting influence that produced Shamela. As a result, Shamela repeatedly articulates pithy proverbs of vice in her letters to her mother, as if to illustrate just how well she has been schooled. For example, she writes, \u201cWhat a foolish Thing it is for a Woman to dally too long with her Lover\u2019s Desires; how many have owed their being old Maids to their holding out too long\u201d (294). When things go sour between mother and daughter, however, the result is a venomous act of retaliation on the part of Mrs. Andrews: the publication of her daughter\u2019s letters\u2013an act to which we owe Fielding\u2019s \u201ccorrected\u201d version of events.\nSince Richardson\u2019s Pamela was aimed at didactically preaching the rewards of virtue, then Fielding\u2019s parody presumes to take the same stance, mocking the original Pamela for its sexual lewdness, its rather scathing portrayal of the vices of the upper class, and its encouragement of disobedience in servants (279). Ironically, however, the two authors actually manage to achieve the same end\u2013the condemnation of hypocrisy\u2013just through very different means: Richardson through sentimentalism, Fielding through satire. Fortunately, Jane Austen was a fan of both authors, and she perfectly combines and tempers, sentimentalism and satire in her novels by adding a healthy portion of realism. True, her early short works like \u201cLove and Freindship\u201d and \u201cLesley Castle\u201d lean more toward the absurdities of Fielding, but by Lady Susan, she has already learned to soften her satire with realism, making it clear she supports virtue and condemns vice, but not at the cost of her sense of humor. She, like Fielding, enjoys a good laugh at the follies of others, but that is because she doesn\u2019t like to take herself or others too seriously.

After listening to Pamela, you will laugh out loud when you hear the same voices transform their accents, grammar, and diction, bringing to life the scandalous characters and conflicts that make Shamela an impressive example of parodic humor.\nFielding was not creating Shamela out of thin air, he was making explicit what was ALREADY implicit in Pamela\u2013i.e., Richardson deliberately wrote Pamela to be read straight by trusting readers, and to be read as Shamela by readers who realized it was also possiible to read Pamela AGAINST the grain\u2013or in my terminology, Fielding made explicit the shadow story of Richardson\u2019s novel.\nJane Austen emulated Richardson\u2019s Pamela and Fielding\u2019s Shamela in the character of Harriet Smith in Emma.

I certainly think part of Fielding\u2019s genius is exposing the two ways of reading Pamela.\nAs for the second point, I would have to think about that. On the one hand, I think Pamela is much more intelligent than Harriet Smith, even if she\u2019s naive in some ways. She\u2019s always much more proactive (to the extent that she may act) than Harriet\u2013but, then, she\u2019s a protagonist, whereas Harriet isn\u2019t. On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure I could buy the idea that Harriet is manipulating Emma. I don\u2019t see textual support for that, though it\u2019s a fun theory. That said, I\u2019m about to reread Emma for my Austen class at DePaul. I\u2019ll try to keep an eye out for Austen\u2019s treatment of Harriet. The biggest problem with this theory, for me, is the ultimate plot dissimilarities between Pamela and Harriet and Harriet and Shamela\u2013namely, there aren\u2019t men buzzing around Harriet, as with Pamela (only one of the men Harriet claims to love actually has romantic interest in her). And it would be odd to say Harriet manipulates men as Shamela does, only to end up with Robert Martin.

It could ease the overwhelming word count.\nI waded through Samuel Richardson\u2019s Pamela, enjoying it immensely. I tried to get through Fielding\u2019s Joseph Andrews and had to put it down. Shamela looks to be much more to my liking (I\u2019ll probably read rather than listen) and you review is excellent in creating interest. I also recommend just about any Naxos recording, whether music or otherwise.", "timestamp": 1555792041000, "doc_text": "\u201cIn my last [letter] I left off at our sitting down to Supper on our Wedding Night, where I behaved with as much Bashfulness as the purest Virgin in the World could have done. The most difficult Task for me was to blush; however, by holding my Breath, and squeezing my Cheeks with my Handkerchief, I did pretty well\u201d (297).\nReading Samuel Richardson\u2019s novel Pamela, Or, Virtue Rewarded, as I recounted in my previous review of it, is not for the faint of heart; but I am happy to say that it was all made worthwhile just this past week as I listened to a Naxos AudioBooks recording of Henry Fielding\u2019s masterful parody fittingly entitled Shamela. Many know Fielding for Tom Jones, but his satirical powers are at full and outrageous height in Shamela. In a quarter of the number of pages found in the original story, Fielding highlights and lampoons all of Richardson\u2019s characteristic tropes, transforming Miss Pamela Andrews from a paragon of female virtue into an archetypical scheming hussy. The great irony is that, as shamefully vicious as Shamela maybe, she is a great deal more fun to listen to than her saintly prototype.\nCentral to Richardson\u2019s sentimental plot was Pamela\u2019s virtue. By virtue, readers must understand two things: her honesty and her virginity. Understandably, Pamela insists on protecting these, since they are her only means for attracting a worthy and, hopefully, wealthy suitor. Because these two meanings of virtue are at the heart of the conflict in Pamela, Fielding places them squarely at the heart of his comedic retelling. Shamela, as her name implies, is anything but honest. In her letters to her mother, she makes it plain that her every action toward Squire Booby (Mr. B\u2019s new name) is aimed at provoking the young man\u2019s sexual passion as a means to coerce him into marriage. Accordingly, her protestations against that gentleman\u2019s sexual advances, while they mirror Pamela\u2019s, are all pretense. She would like nothing better than for her employer to seduce her, but not before she secures a share of his fortune for herself. As she tells Mrs. Jervis: \u201c\u2026Fellows have often taken away in the Morning, what they gave over Night. No, Mrs. Jervis, nothing under a regular taking into Keeping, a settled Settlement, for me, and all my Heirs, all my whole Liftetime, shall do the Business\u2013or else crosslegged, is the Word\u2026\u201d (283). Of course, as the quote with which I opened this review indicates, Shamela is no virgin anyway!\nAs you might have guessed, Pamela is not the only character whose personality Fielding changes for comedic effect\u2013all the major characters are the opposite of their originals. Mr. B is a fool, Mr. Williams is a lascivious skamp, Mrs. Jervis is a coconspirator, and, best of all, Pamela\u2019s parents are low-class trash. Indeed, while the original Pamela\u2019s father writes ad nauseum to his daughter about her Christian duty, Shamela\u2019s father is serving time in prison. And Shamela\u2019s mother is little better. Readers are told she \u201csold Oranges in the Play-House,\u201d a not so subtle way to say she was a prostitute (280).\nIn fact, Shamela\u2019s mother\u2013whose regal name, Henrietta Maria Honora Andrews, belies her tawdry lifestyle\u2013steals this story\u2019s spotlight, for it was her corrupting influence that produced Shamela. As a result, Shamela repeatedly articulates pithy proverbs of vice in her letters to her mother, as if to illustrate just how well she has been schooled. For example, she writes, \u201cWhat a foolish Thing it is for a Woman to dally too long with her Lover\u2019s Desires; how many have owed their being old Maids to their holding out too long\u201d (294). When things go sour between mother and daughter, however, the result is a venomous act of retaliation on the part of Mrs. Andrews: the publication of her daughter\u2019s letters\u2013an act to which we owe Fielding\u2019s \u201ccorrected\u201d version of events.\nSince Richardson\u2019s Pamela was aimed at didactically preaching the rewards of virtue, then Fielding\u2019s parody presumes to take the same stance, mocking the original Pamela for its sexual lewdness, its rather scathing portrayal of the vices of the upper class, and its encouragement of disobedience in servants (279). Ironically, however, the two authors actually manage to achieve the same end\u2013the condemnation of hypocrisy\u2013just through very different means: Richardson through sentimentalism, Fielding through satire. Fortunately, Jane Austen was a fan of both authors, and she perfectly combines and tempers, sentimentalism and satire in her novels by adding a healthy portion of realism. True, her early short works like \u201cLove and Freindship\u201d and \u201cLesley Castle\u201d lean more toward the absurdities of Fielding, but by Lady Susan, she has already learned to soften her satire with realism, making it clear she supports virtue and condemns vice, but not at the cost of her sense of humor. She, like Fielding, enjoys a good laugh at the follies of others, but that is because she doesn\u2019t like to take herself or others too seriously. After all, the ability to laugh was just as important to the Austen family as the ability to pray.\nThat said, I highly recommend the audio recording of this hilarious work, which I award five bright stars.

[letter] I left off at our sitting down to Supper on our Wedding Night, where I behaved with as much Bashfulness as the purest Virgin in the World could have done. The most difficult Task for me was to blush; however, by holding my Breath, and squeezing my Cheeks with my Handkerchief, I did pretty well\u201d (297).\nReading Samuel Richardson\u2019s novel Pamela, Or, Virtue Rewarded, as I recounted in my previous review of it, is not for the faint of heart; but I am happy to say that it was all made worthwhile just this past week as I listened to a Naxos AudioBooks recording of Henry Fielding\u2019s masterful parody fittingly entitled Shamela. Many know Fielding for Tom Jones, but his satirical powers are at full and outrageous height in Shamela. In a quarter of the number of pages found in the original story, Fielding highlights and lampoons all of Richardson\u2019s characteristic tropes, transforming Miss Pamela Andrews from a paragon of female virtue into an archetypical scheming hussy. The great irony is that, as shamefully vicious as Shamela maybe, she is a great deal more fun to listen to than her saintly prototype.\nCentral to Richardson\u2019s sentimental plot was Pamela\u2019s virtue. By virtue, readers must understand two things: her honesty and her virginity. Understandably, Pamela insists on protecting these, since they are her only means for attracting a worthy and, hopefully, wealthy suitor. Because these two meanings of virtue are at the heart of the conflict in Pamela, Fielding places them squarely at the heart of his comedic retelling. Shamela, as her name implies, is anything but honest. In her letters to her mother, she makes it plain that her every action toward Squire Booby (Mr. B\u2019s new name) is aimed at provoking the young man\u2019s sexual passion as a means to coerce him into marriage. Accordingly, her protestations against that gentleman\u2019s sexual advances, while they mirror Pamela\u2019s, are all pretense. She would like nothing better than for her employer to seduce her, but not before she secures a share of his fortune for herself. As she tells Mrs. Jervis: \u201c...Fellows have often taken away in the Morning, what they gave over Night. No, Mrs. Jervis, nothing under a regular taking into Keeping, a settled Settlement, for me, and all my Heirs, all my whole Liftetime, shall do the Business\u2013or else crosslegged, is the Word...\u201d (283). Of course, as the quote with which I opened this review indicates, Shamela is no virgin anyway!\nAs you might have guessed, Pamela is not the only character whose personality Fielding changes for comedic effect\u2013all the major characters are the opposite of their originals. Mr. B is a fool, Mr. Williams is a lascivious skamp, Mrs. Jervis is a coconspirator, and, best of all, Pamela\u2019s parents are low-class trash. Indeed, while the original Pamela\u2019s father writes ad nauseum to his daughter about her Christian duty, Shamela\u2019s father is serving time in prison. And Shamela\u2019s mother is little better. Readers are told she \u201csold Oranges in the Play-House,\u201d a not so subtle way to say she was a prostitute (280).\nIn fact, Shamela\u2019s mother\u2013whose regal name, Henrietta Maria Honora Andrews, belies her tawdry lifestyle\u2013steals this story\u2019s spotlight, for it was her corrupting influence that produced Shamela. As a result, Shamela repeatedly articulates pithy proverbs of vice in her letters to her mother, as if to illustrate just how well she has been schooled. For example, she writes, \u201cWhat a foolish Thing it is for a Woman to dally too long with her Lover\u2019s Desires; how many have owed their being old Maids to their holding out too long\u201d (294). When things go sour between mother and daughter, however, the result is a venomous act of retaliation on the part of Mrs. Andrews: the publication of her daughter\u2019s letters\u2013an act to which we owe Fielding\u2019s \u201ccorrected\u201d version of events.\nSince Richardson\u2019s Pamela was aimed at didactically preaching the rewards of virtue, then Fielding\u2019s parody presumes to take the same stance, mocking the original Pamela for its sexual lewdness, its rather scathing portrayal of the vices of the upper class, and its encouragement of disobedience in servants (279). Ironically, however, the two authors actually manage to achieve the same end\u2013the condemnation of hypocrisy\u2013just through very different means: Richardson through sentimentalism, Fielding through satire. Fortunately, Jane Austen was a fan of both authors, and she perfectly combines and tempers, sentimentalism and satire in her novels by adding a healthy portion of realism. True, her early short works like \u201cLove and Freindship\u201d and \u201cLesley Castle\u201d lean more toward the absurdities of Fielding, but by Lady Susan, she has already learned to soften her satire with realism, making it clear she supports virtue and condemns vice, but not at the cost of her sense of humor. She, like Fielding, enjoys a good laugh at the follies of others, but that is because she doesn\u2019t like to take herself or others too seriously. After all, the ability to laugh was just as important to the Austen family as the ability to pray.\nThat said, I highly recommend the audio recording of this hilarious work, which I award five bright stars. After listening to Pamela, you will laugh out loud when you hear the same voices transform their accents, grammar, and diction, bringing to life the scandalous characters and conflicts that make Shamela an impressive example of parodic humor.\nFielding was not creating Shamela out of thin air, he was making explicit what was ALREADY implicit in Pamela\u2013i.e., Richardson deliberately wrote Pamela to be read straight by trusting readers, and to be read as Shamela by readers who realized it was also possiible to read Pamela AGAINST the grain\u2013or in my terminology, Fielding made explicit the shadow story of Richardson\u2019s novel.\nJane Austen emulated Richardson\u2019s Pamela and Fielding\u2019s Shamela in the character of Harriet Smith in Emma. I.e., Harriet can be read straight as the naive simpleton whom Emma adopts as a human pet, or she can be read as a clever scheming manipulator who plays Emma like a violin with a FAKE dumb blonde act.\nArnie, your first point is well taken. I certainly think part of Fielding\u2019s genius is exposing the two ways of reading Pamela.\nAs for the second point, I would have to think about that. On the one hand, I think Pamela is much more intelligent than Harriet Smith, even if she\u2019s naive in some ways. She\u2019s always much more proactive (to the extent that she may act) than Harriet\u2013but, then, she\u2019s a protagonist, whereas Harriet isn\u2019t. On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure I could buy the idea that Harriet is manipulating Emma. I don\u2019t see textual support for that, though it\u2019s a fun theory. That said, I\u2019m about to reread Emma for my Austen class at DePaul. I\u2019ll try to keep an eye out for Austen\u2019s treatment of Harriet. The biggest problem with this theory, for me, is the ultimate plot dissimilarities between Pamela and Harriet and Harriet and Shamela\u2013namely, there aren\u2019t men buzzing around Harriet, as with Pamela (only one of the men Harriet claims to love actually has romantic interest in her). And it would be odd to say Harriet manipulates men as Shamela does, only to end up with Robert Martin. Having just read Pamela and Shamela, I\u2019ll be open to looking for the similarities you point out.\nGreat review of what sounds like a first-rate audio execution.\nTry the audio of Pamela Jane.

{"url": "https://coincentral.com/as-market-slides-crypto-hedge-funds-go-down-with-it/", "text": "Crypto\u2019s flagship, Bitcoin, has been slowly sinking this year, bringing the rest of the market with it, and rather than go down with them, cryptocurrency hedge funds are jumping ship.\nSince the beginning of the year, 9 such hedge funds have ceased operations completely, Bloomberg reports. Many of these were created during last year\u2019s market boom, bringing 167 fresh funds into the fold. This suffusion of new blood added to the 39 funds created from 2011-2016, upping to total to more than 200 active cryptocurrency hedge funds managing an estimated $3.5-5bln in assets.\nBy contrast, only 20 funds have been established in 2018 thus far, putting the industry on track to produce roughly 120 new funds by the end of the year. Given the 9 that have already bitten the dust so far this year, though, the final tally could very well be much less.\nWith to-date returns in 2018 of -23.31%\u2013which is in brutally stark contrast to the 1,708.50% returns these funds averaged in 2017\u2013negative bottom lines and market uncertainty are no doubt driving these closures. This same market uncertainty could leave 10% of these funds kaput by year\u2019s end, according to Autonomous Research LLP\u2019s global director of fintech strategy, Lex Sokolin. Rick Marini, a founding partner of Protocol Ventures, believes that only 50 of the currently active funds will be able to raise enough capital by 2019 to stay afloat.\nMoney Out of Reach or Just Playing Hide and Seek?\nEven as investors shy away from cryptocurrencies and hedge funds close up shop, capital, in some form or another, is still finding its way into the crpytocurrency space. The money\u2019s still there\u2013if you know where to look.\nAnd if you\u2019re a blockchain/crypto entrepreneur, the money is still there if you know who to look to. Returns may be down, but 2018\u2019s venture capital investments, for example, are still on pace to match or surpass last year\u2019s $1bln in funding. So far, venture capital groups have poured over $350mln into projects this year alone.\nOne such project, Blockstream, a blockchain development organization, raised $55mln in its Series A investing round in February of this year, and it\u2019s not alone. In a Series B, Bitpay also attracted 7-figures in funding with a total of $40mln in investment capital.\nOutside of venture capital, 2018 has also seen the largest acquisition of a cryptocurrency company so far in the industry\u2019s young history. In late February, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., a Goldman Sachs-backed company, purchased Poloniex exchange for a whopping $400mln. Since this buyout, other companies have considered following suit, such as Tokyo-based internet broker Monex, which has debated purchasing the Japanese exchange Coincheck.\nHedge funds are taking a hit for now, and given the meteoric rise of these funds at a time when picking a successful investment was as easy as playing blindfold-less pin the tail on the donkey, more will likely drop off as the year progresses. VC investments and multi-million dollar acquisitions like those previously mentioned, though, indicate that, even during the market downturn, institutional money isn\u2019t waiting on the sidelines to get its skin in the game.\nIf hedge funds continue to strike out, big players may step up to bat in other areas of the industry as they look for home run opportunities.", "timestamp": 1555772002000, "doc_text": "Crypto\u2019s flagship, Bitcoin, has been slowly sinking this year, bringing the rest of the market with it, and rather than go down with them, cryptocurrency hedge funds are jumping ship.\nSince the beginning of the year,", "token_ids_start_true": [29028, 174555, 1005, 5395, 1005, 1417, 4090, 30309, 2053, 1005, 4407, 6056, 1663, 5924, 1005, 1265, 1969, 24244, 4465, 1005, 14323, 69675, 1298, 11300, 3854, 1295, 4, 187632, 7873, 1005], "token_texts_start_true": ["\u2581Crypto", "\u2019s\u2581flagship", ",", "\u2581Bitcoin", ",", "\u2581has\u2581been", "\u2581slowly", "\u2581sinking", "\u2581this\u2581year", ",", "\u2581bringing", "\u2581the\u2581rest\u2581of\u2581the", "\u2581market", "\u2581with\u2581it", ",", "\u2581and", "\u2581rather\u2581than", "\u2581go\u2581down", "\u2581with\u2581them", ",", "\u2581cryptocurrency", "\u2581hedge\u2581funds", "\u2581are", "\u2581jumping", "\u2581ship", ".", "<|newline|>", "\u2581Since\u2581the\u2581beginning", "\u2581of\u2581the\u2581year", ","], "token_ids_start_false": [118361, 174555, 1005, 5395, 1005, 1417, 4090, 30309, 2053, 1005, 4407, 6056, 1663, 5924, 1005, 1265, 1969, 24244, 4465, 1005, 14323, 69675, 1298, 11300, 3854, 1295, 4, 187632, 7873, 1005], "decoded_text_from_start_true": "Crypto\u2019s flagship, Bitcoin, has been slowly sinking this year, bringing the rest of the market with it, and rather than go down with them, cryptocurrency hedge funds are jumping ship.\nSince the beginning of the year,", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 6], [6, 17], [17, 18], [18, 26], [26, 27], [27, 36], [36, 43], [43, 51], [51, 61], [61, 62], [62, 71], [71, 87], [87, 94], [94, 102], [102, 103], [103, 107], [107, 119], [119, 127], [127, 137], [137, 138], [138, 153], [153, 165], [165, 169], [169, 177], [177, 182], [182, 183], [183, 184], [184, 203], [203, 215], [215, 216]]}

The good news is that it isn\u2019t just LASIK for the under 50 year old anymore.\nIf you have good driving vision and are in your forties, fifties or sixties, but can\u2019t read without your glasses, then we have the new Raindrop\u00ae corneal inlay to restore reading vision. The Raindrop is the most exciting new technology to come along in the past 10 years.\nThey have been in use for a number of years in Europe and Asia, and FDA approved in 2016 in the US. It is a non-LASIK method of placing a 30 micron thick, 2.5mm inlay lens in the cornea to regain uncorrected reading without diminishing binocular distance vision.\nThe procedure takes about 10 minutes and performed in the office with minimal discomfort. You can return to most normal activity the very next day. The reading vision begins to improve over the first seven days, but can continue to improve up to six months. Most patients showed and improvement in reading vision anywhere from 3\u20135 lines on the vision chart. Binocular distance vision was not significantly impacted but the Raindrop eye showed half a line of distance vision decrease.\nIf you have cataracts, and don\u2019t want to wear thick reading glasses, then there is the new Symfony\u00ae extended range intraocular lens implant that allows good vision for driving, computer range and reading. This implant has become extremely popular over the past two years for people who want to minimize reliance on glasses for distance and near activity after cataract surgery. It also treats astigmatism, unlike the older multifocal cataract implants. People report far less night glare and halo and improved intermediate and computer vision, making it ideal for people in their fifties, sixties and seventies who like to use the computer for work or for fun.\nEven in the field of LASIK, there are new lasers that make super fine flaps, thus allowing safe LASIK in thinner corneas and new wavefront technology to allow more precise and micro pinpoint treatment to reduce symptoms such as halo, glare and astigmatism.\nLastly, in the under 40 population, with a prescription too high for LASIK, we have new implantable contact lens (ICL) technology that allows for treatment of nearsightedness and astigmatism as well.\nAll of these exciting new technologies can lead to significant reduction dependence on glasses. Not all of these are appropriate for everyone and the best way to see what is the best option for you is to schedule an evaluation with a specialists.", "timestamp": 1556209357000, "doc_text": "Exciting new options for decreasing or even eliminating the need for glasses are here.

The good news is that it isn\u2019t just LASIK for the under 50 year old anymore.\nIf you have good driving vision and are in your forties, fifties or sixties, but can\u2019t read without your glasses, then we have the new Raindrop\u00ae corneal inlay to restore reading vision. The Raindrop is the most exciting new technology to come along in the past 10 years.\nThey have been in use for a number of years in Europe and Asia, and FDA approved in 2016 in the US. It is a non-LASIK method of placing a 30 micron thick, 2.5mm inlay lens in the cornea to regain uncorrected reading without diminishing binocular distance vision.\nThe procedure takes about 10 minutes and performed in the office with minimal discomfort. You can return to most normal activity the very next day. The reading vision begins to improve over the first seven days, but can continue to improve up to six months. Most patients showed and improvement in reading vision anywhere from 3\u20135 lines on the vision chart. Binocular distance vision was not significantly impacted but the Raindrop eye showed half a line of distance vision decrease.\nIf you have cataracts, and don\u2019t want to wear thick reading glasses, then there is the new Symfony\u00ae extended range intraocular lens implant that allows good vision for driving, computer range and reading.

Here\u2019s a great solution. Round Up Quick Pro and Prodiamine are compatible for tank mixing, which means you can put them out together. Save time, effort and money.\nRoundup QuickPRO is a nonselective postemergent herbicide for commercial, industrial, non-crop and residential use. QuickPRO has two active ingredients: 73.3% glyphosate and 2.9% diquat. The addition of diquat, along with the surfactant, gives you even faster burndown. It controls broadleaf and grass weeds, or woody brush and trees \u2013 roots and all. Roundup Quick Pro is absorbed quickly by plants and is rain fast in about an hour. This super-fast dry time means rain won\u2019t wash the product away as easily and it works much faster than typical glyphosphate products. 6.8 lb jug comes with a convenient 6 oz measuring cap. Mix 1.5 oz per gallon of water for effective weed and grass control.\nProdiamine 65 WDG is a pre-emergent crabgrass control solution that contains 65% prodiamine active ingredient. Prodiamine is a generic form of Barricade. Prodiamine is just as effective on controling crabgrass and far less expensive. Prodiamine is an effective pre-emergent herbicide for pre-emergent crabgrass and broadleaf weed control. Prodiamine can be applied in the spring and fall for year-long crabgrass control. Prodiamine 65 also helps control bluegrass, spurge, witchgrass and others. It can be safely used on St. Augustine, Bermudagrass, Fescue and other common turf grasses (see label for complete list). Prodiamine 65 WDG is non-staining and can be mixed and applied with fertilizer and iron solutions.

Will keep area clear of all vegitation for up to one year.\nStone Brothers and Byrd has been helping folks in the Durham, NC area with their lawn and garden needs since 1914. In nearly 100 years, we've learned what works well and our passion is to share that knowledge with new generations of folks who like to roll up their sleeves and get dirty. You've come to the right place to find information on pre-emergent and post-emergent weed control. Crabgrass control can be obtained only by a combined regimen of pre- and post-emergent action. Prodiamine is an excellent pre-emergent solution for crabgrass, dallisgrass and many other tough broadleaf weeds. For post-emergent crabgrass control MSMA offers very effective control. Stone Brothers offers many products to control broadleaf weeds such as crabgrass, stickers, sandburrs, nutsedge and others. Stone Brothers also offers excellent products to kill and control bedbugs, roaches and fleas.

control with these two outstanding products.\nLooking to knock-down existing weeds and inhibit further weed-seed germination for months at the same time? Here\u2019s a great solution. Round Up Quick Pro and Prodiamine are compatible for tank mixing, which means you can put them out together. Save time, effort and money.\nRoundup QuickPRO is a nonselective postemergent herbicide for commercial, industrial, non-crop and residential use. QuickPRO has two active ingredients: 73.3% glyphosate and 2.9% diquat. The addition of diquat, along with the surfactant, gives you even faster burndown. It controls broadleaf and grass weeds, or woody brush and trees \u2013 roots and all. Roundup Quick Pro is absorbed quickly by plants and is rain fast in about an hour. This super-fast dry time means rain won\u2019t wash the product away as easily and it works much faster than typical glyphosphate products. 6.8 lb jug comes with a convenient 6 oz measuring cap. Mix 1.5 oz per gallon of water for effective weed and grass control.\nProdiamine 65 WDG is a pre-emergent crabgrass control solution that contains 65% prodiamine active ingredient. Prodiamine is a generic form of Barricade. Prodiamine is just as effective on controling crabgrass and far less expensive. Prodiamine is an effective pre-emergent herbicide for pre-emergent crabgrass and broadleaf weed control. Prodiamine can be applied in the spring and fall for year-long crabgrass control. Prodiamine 65 also helps control bluegrass, spurge, witchgrass and others. It can be safely used on St. Augustine, Bermudagrass, Fescue and other common turf grasses (see label for complete list). Prodiamine 65 WDG is non-staining and can be mixed and applied with fertilizer and iron solutions. This five pound container will cover approximately four acres.\nTrimec herbicide with \u201cantifreeze\u201d for cold weather weed control.\nPre- AND Post-emergent control for tough broadleaf

If you're not familiar with ID cards, you may think a slot refers to a randomly placed slit in a card, which wouldn't make much sense.\nInstead, a slotted ID card is an ID card that has a small, oval-shaped notch taken out of the card material. A slot is used to make it easy to attach the card to an accessory like a lanyard, badge reel or strap clip.\nSlots are put into card using a slot punch, which is similar to the handheld hole punches you probably used in elementary school art class.\nSlots can be put on both the horizontal and vertical edge of an ID card.\nWhy use a slotted ID card?\nPeople aren't punching slots in their shiny, new ID cards for no reason \u2014 they're useful!\nThe most obvious advantage offered by a slotted ID card is that it's easier to carry and display.\nHaving a slot on your ID allows it to be easily paired with a strap clip, lanyard or badge reel. These accessories can just slide through the slot for an easy, secure solution.\nUnslotted ID cards, on the other hand, are harder to display.\nThere are accessories like card clamps that can hold an ID card without needing a slot, but they aren't as secure as a clip through a slot.\nIn fact, if a card is designed to be worn or displayed and isn't slotted, it's usually paired with a slotted badge holder to make things easier.\nDo I need to put a slot in my ID card?\nThere can be arguments made for both sides, but it really comes down your unique situation. Answering the questions below can help give you a clearer idea of what's best for your cards.\nNote: A \"yes\" or \"no\" below doesn't necessarily mean \"yes, slot your cards\" or \"no, don't.\" Instead, it's referring to the question asked in the header.\nAre you planning to display/wear your ID cards?\nIf your answer is YES, slotting your ID cards is a good idea. It will make it easier to find the perfect accessory for wearing the card.\nIf your answer is NO, you don't need to worry about slotting your cards. If a card is going to be kept in a wallet or pocket, there's no sense in putting in a slot.\nDoes your card contain internal technology?\nIf your answer is YES, you should only slot your ID cards if they have guidelines like the ones to the right. These guidelines (or guide dots, to be more accurate) show the \"safe space\" where a card can be slotted without puncturing the internal wire or chip.\nIf your answer is NO, you're free to slot your ID cards without worry, according to your other needs.\nWhat is your ID card made of?\nIf your ID card is made of PVC, you can slot the card, but do so carefully: putting the slot too close to the edge of the card", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 6], [6, 18], [18, 19], [19, 29], [29, 37], [37, 50], [50, 53], [53, 61], [61, 69], [69, 71], [71, 85], [85, 99], [99, 107], [107, 108], [108,

Our subconscious mind has been programmed to ensure we survive even though we are no longer in danger of the same external threats.\nThese survival-games we played (and won!) have shaped us deeply. But now we are ready for more.\nIn the last couple of hundred years, roughly since the industrial revolution, we have changed the rules of this game. We have harnessed the environment, made strong alliances to ensure our safety, and constructed rules and laws to ensure good behavior amongst each other. We no longer need these old survival strategies.\nIn his 20+ years as a HR consultant and coach, Harry de Bont, developed an extensive, five stage model that describes and provides clear insights into these fear-based pitfalls and offers a courage-based strategy at each stage to align your actions and energy in a more effective way.\nIf you are ready to step into the future version of yourself with confidence and upgrade your life, please join us for this full day deep dive into the model that has changed individuals and company cultures over the last two decades. Find out how it feels to be free of your fear pattern and engage your field of potential. Adapt a courage-based strategy and get ready to celebrate your wins in life!\nLearn and explore the five dominant (fear based) survival-strategies and how they often impact your life in a negative manner, holding you back from growing.\nLearn how to overcome pitfalls that these fear-based strategies generate in modern day life.\nLearn new, courage based strategies that you will be able to apply in a playful manner and that will naturally guide you towards full living up to your potential and realizing your goals.\nGain insights why some are patronizing or drawn to be aggressive and some are vulnerable to a burn-out or depression.\nDiscuss and share challenges that switching to a courage-based strategy will impose on you.\nGain a clear vision how these courage-based strategies will change your life.\nLeave the training with a new perspective, a new mindset and an intention to change for the better.\nThe day will be inspirational and impactful, with interactive group (and pair) activities with playful exercises.

Discover how we solved this problem for one customer.\nI had Garage Door Repair in Maplewood send out one of their technicians this morning because our insulated garage doors stopped working just when we had to leave the house for work, and the car was stuck inside. Luckily, this service was fast! In less than an hour the technician was here and got to work straight away. He found that one of the torsion springs was broken, and replaced them both to make sure it won't give us any trouble. Really fast and impressive work! This is a great company to call if you need anything fixed ASAP, we'll definitely keep their number close.\nHow scared I got when I saw the overhead door coming down and not stopping in the presence of my cat. I thought my silly pet would move but she froze there till I grabbed her the last minute. I called your company at once and was desperate for immediate service. The person on the phone assured me that someone would be in my house soon and they did send someone fast. The technician just had to adjust the sensors but all the same he checked the balance and force of the door, too. He was great and very professional.\nWe didn't want to just trust anybody for the service of our electric opener. It was apparent that there was something wrong with the reverse system and we wanted to be sure that the problem would be fixed right since it was related to our safety. We practically checked out many garage door companies but the only one which struck us as a good professional was Garage Door Repair Maplewood. It was an excellent choice. The technician was experienced and completely devoted to the repair task at hand. Not only did he fix the problem but also checked the whole system.\nIt wasn't the first time I was calling Maplewood Garage Door Repair. Though, till now I just needed a normal routine service or help replacing the bottom seal. This time, it was obvious that the problem was bigger. I explained how the door moved and they immediately suspected the garage door springs. The spring problem was confirmed by the technician, who came to my home later. The door wouldn't open right because the springs needed adjustment. It was amazing that they were able to tell me on the phone what was wrong with the door but then again, they have experience.\nI have been using the services of your company for some time now and I am really pleased. It hasn't been a time when the technicians were late or didn't do a good job. On the contrary, they keep surprising me with their knowledge and expertise every time they come for services. My overhead door was kind of old and I need garage door repair services relatively often. The (funny) thing is that the problems get stranger and stranger every time but your technicians always know what to do about them. They are awesome and I like that they are always well-equipped and courteous. My congratulations!\nWe were at some friends' house and the guy went on and on about his new garage door opener as if he was talking about a new Porsche or something. He annoyed me but also got me interested. The following day, I called Garage Door Repair Maplewood. I told them I was interested in new openers. I met with one of the company's contractors later that day and he told me so much about new age electric operators, I finally got a new one. They had it replaced two days later and since then I can't stop talking about it.\nThanks for the instant response and the expert cable replacement service. I\u2019m keeping the phone number of your garage door company to call in whenever needed. You are the best!\nYou were extremely quick to arrive when my garage door was off track and repaired it in no time at all. I appreciate the expert service and reasonable price.

Bipolar disorder is at least as problematic for families of those affected. Bipolar I disorder might also be called manic depression. Bipolar disorder is found in lots of variations. It is not a mental illness. It is usually a life-long condition. There's no surefire approach to stop bipolar disorder but getting treatment at the first sign will enable a individual.\nIf you are experiencing Bipolar Disorder, you should be aware that help is available. Bipolar disorder may cause changes in power and behaviour. It is now the psychiatrists ( as well as lay persons) favorite tag recently. Bipolar disorder in young folks are able to co-exist with various difficulties.\nYoull cooperate with your doctor to select a mixture of drugs or the perfect drug perfect for your requirements if you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a severe illness that's also referred to as manic-depressive illness. It's truly also called manic depression, this is where mood and behaviour suddenly changes. Like diabetes or cardiovascular disease, it is a long-term illness that has to be carefully managed throughout a person's life. It can have a dramatic effect on a person's functioning. Basic approaches to manage bipolar disorder are therapy, medication, and a mixture of the two.\nIf you're experiencing bipolar disorder, you ought to be aware that help is available. Bipolar disorder demands therapy. In most cases, it's much better controlled if treatment is continuous than if it's on and off. It can be a dark and frightening illness but your therapist can help you get to the light and give you the support that you will need to stay there. It is a result of disturbances in the areas of the brain that regulate mood. It is a chronic illness, so it's necessary to continue treatment even when you're feeling.

In its early days Christchurch was particularly beset with the problem of water-borne diseases such as dysentery and typhoid.

Where the volume of wastewater is not sufficient to cause a rapid flow, or where the pipe grades are too flat, it is sometimes necessary to flush extra water down line through the pipes to move wastewater along.\nBark biofilters are used in 33 locations to treat odours from the wastewater network.\nThe Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant at Bromley treats the wastewater from all of urban Christchurch (as well as Tai Tapu). The average daily flow is 185,000,000 litres per day. The highly treated wastewater is discharged through a 1.8 metre diameter pipe which has its outlet 3 kilometres into the Pacific Ocean off South New Brighton.\nThe Akaroa Harbour treatment plants have to cope with the wastewater from large numbers of tourists so the type and amount of wastewater that arrives at the treatment plants can change quite dramatically from winter to summer and even from weekday to weekend or on busy public holidays. This can cause variations in the treatment process.\nThe standard of the treated wastewater is monitored by the Council and Environment Canterbury to meet the resource consent conditions.\nMany of the treatment plants will have upgrades or changes in the near future, including the Akaroa wastewater scheme, the Lyttelton Harbour wastewater scheme and the Wainui wastewater scheme.", "timestamp": 1555693029000, "doc_text": "Our wastewater system includes eight treatment plants, connected to our homes and businesses by pipes, manholes and pumping stations.\nPipes and pump stations convey wastewater (sewage) from homes and businesses to eight treatment plants, one in Christchurch and seven on Banks Peninsula.\nThe City of Christchurch was built on low, flat, water-logged land and with no sewage system and cesspits for the wastewater.

stations.\nPipes and pump stations convey wastewater (sewage) from homes and businesses to eight treatment plants, one in Christchurch and seven on Banks Peninsula.\nThe City of Christchurch was built on low, flat, water-logged land and with no sewage system and cesspits for the wastewater. In its early days Christchurch was particularly beset with the problem of water-borne diseases such as dysentery and typhoid. In 1874 it had the highest death rate of any centre in New Zealand.\nWith this as a background, in 1875 the Christchurch Drainage Board was formed and construction on Christchurch\u2019s first pump station and first piped network was started in the late 1870s.\nThe original Number One Pump Station on the corner of Tuam St and Mathesons Rd is still standing (minus its smoke stack) and is a privately owned demolition sale yard.\nNow a vast network of 2,679 kilometres of public wastewater pipes, 30,817 manholes and 239 pumping, lift and vacuum stations continuously convey wastewater to the Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant for treatment and disposal.\nCompared to other New Zealand cities, Christchurch is much flatter and, due to its unique environmental features, has its own particular wastewater network challenges. Pumping is required on the plains as the ground is often too flat for gravity alone to naturally move the wastewater load along. For more information on the Christchurch wastewater system, see facts and figures.\nIt is important that wastewater gets to the treatment plant as soon as possible to avoid odour generated from its decay. The length of time wastewater takes will depend on the distance from the treatment plant (one to 24 hours maximum).\nChristchurch has a particular problem with this as it has one of the flattest wastewater systems in the world.

During that time period this general style were referred to as \"cocked hats\". At the peak of its popularity, the cocked hat (tricorn) varied greatly in style and size, and was worn not only by the aristocracy, but also as common civilian dress, and as part of military and naval uniforms.\nThe hat's most distinguishing characteristic was that three sides of the brim were turned up (cocked) and either pinned, laced or buttoned in place to form a triangle around the crown. The hat was typically worn with the point facing forward.\nHISTORY: The tricorn appeared as a result of the evolution of the broad-brim round hat. By pledging (binding) the brims, a triangular shape was obtained. This shape was favored by Spanish soldiers and in 1667, war broke out between France and Spain in the Spanish Netherlands. During the subsequent military struggle, its use spread to the French armies. The style was brought back to France, where its usage spread to the French population and the royal court of King Louis XIV, who made it fashionable throughout Europe, both as a civilian and military wear. They remained one of the predominant European styles of hat throughout the 18th century; however, by the 1800's they soon became out of style to be replaced by the bicorne.\nIn the United States, only the first five Presidents, from George Washington to James Monroe, wore this style of hat according to the fashion of the 18th century. James Monroe earned the nickname \"The Last Cocked Hat\" because of this.\nWhat a great product from a great seller!", "timestamp": 1555762834000, "doc_text": "This three cornered hat is made", "token_ids_start_true": [1308, 1548, 141382, 7381, 8933], "token_texts_start_true": ["\u2581This", "\u2581three", "\u2581cornered", "\u2581hat", "\u2581is\u2581made"], "token_ids_start_false": [7906, 1548, 141382, 7381, 8933], "decoded_text_from_start_true": "This three cornered hat is made", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 4], [4, 10], [10, 19], [19, 23], [23, 31]]}

We noticed one instance where the changedate value included \"timeweighted\".

What would cause the 'timeweighted' to appear?\n@Tim: I couldn't think of something different than a configuration change on that PI Point. Can you get the value of the changer attribute, this should tell you would made the change if different from the last time.\nIs the ptsecurity attribute is defined correctly to allow only administrators to change the configuration?\nPoints can belong to different Point classes and different point classes have different point attributes.\nTags that are serviced by the PI Totalizer subsystem are member of the \"Totalizer\" point class which has an attribute \"CalcMode\" that I believe is unique for \"Totalizer\" point class - at least with the default point classes.\nWhen retrieving the configuration of \"Totalizer\" tags using PI SMT add-in for Microsoft Excel, I see \"CalcMode\" on the left hand side besides \"changedate\" attribute.\nIs it possible the information within \"CalcMode\" has been merged into \"changedate\" within your application?\nBecause all point classes use the attributes from \"Base\" class plus additional ones, I suggest storing configuration data separated by point classes within your application - if this makes sense to you.\nWhat's the purpose of your application? Are you auditing the point table?\nIf you could please attach a spreadsheet generated using PI Tag Configurator, which is an add-in of Excel, with the configuration of this specific tag, we might be able to help you better.\nIf you don\u00b4t know how to do that, please let us know and we will help you!\nsmall problem with that is that i cant reproduce this scenario. one of our customers found this issue. I just would like to know some possibilities where \"Timewheighted\" would appear in the changedate attribute of a tag. From the discussion thus far it seems like it could be stemming from a Totalizator point class.\nWhat is the purpose of the Totalizer point class, what would be a scenario where someone would use this class?\nI can only assume that your \"tuning\" application changes tag attributes used by Exception and Compression. I understand the motivation for the attempt to make a PI system managers life easier. However to apply good Exception and Compression settings it's not only necessary to have a good understanding how Exception and Compression works. Rather one also needs a good understanding of the process data and about the \"interface\" collecting the data and servicing tags in PI. This said, I wouldn't trust into any kind of automation but prefer maintaining settings manually. This doesn't imply to find a good setting for each individual tag or that each individual tag needs to be set up manually.\nBased on data types and value ranges, basic settings can be suggested that will deliver good results in the majority of cases and make a fine tuning necessary only for a smaller percentage of tags only i.e. those supposed to record pretty busy signals. I consider reviewing recorded data a necessary requirement. Asking the \"data users\" for their opinion is a good practice. Signals that require changes can usually be grouped, so settings need to be evaluated for a smaller subset of tags only and could than be applied for others of the same kind. PI SMT Tag Builder add-in for Microsoft Excel is my preferred tool for this kind of work.\nPI Totalizer Subsystem is a calculation engine belonging to the so called PI Server applications. Because of the specific configuration requirements (additional attributes) of PI Totalizer Subsystem all belonging tags are using \"Totalizer\" point class. I recommend not treating tags with pointclass = \"Totalizer\" with your \"tuning\" application since this may have a direct impact on calculation results. PI Totalizer may report status \"Configure\", \"Bad Sample\" or similar because of the changed configuration until the next reset (clock scheduled or event triggered) occurs.\nHi Rhys, not a problem! I think I've got the answer to my question and have forwarded the issue over to our developers to be fixed. If you'd like to know more about our product you can visit our website and download a free trial of CompressionInsight. You can also contact me at tim.read@patterndiscovery.com.\nAgain, thanks to all who helped with this question.

Can you get the value of the changer attribute, this should tell you would made the change if different from the last time.\nIs the ptsecurity attribute is defined correctly to allow only administrators to change the configuration?\nPoints can belong to different Point classes and different point classes have different point attributes.\nTags that are serviced by the PI Totalizer subsystem are member of the \"Totalizer\" point class which has an attribute \"CalcMode\" that I believe is unique for \"Totalizer\" point class - at least with the default point classes.\nWhen retrieving the configuration of \"Totalizer\" tags using PI SMT add-in for Microsoft Excel, I see \"CalcMode\" on the left hand side besides \"changedate\" attribute.\nIs it possible the information within \"CalcMode\" has been merged into \"changedate\" within your application?\nBecause all point classes use the attributes from \"Base\" class plus additional ones, I suggest storing configuration data separated by point classes within your application - if this makes sense to you.\nWhat's the purpose of your application? Are you auditing the point table?\nIf you could please attach a spreadsheet generated using PI Tag Configurator, which is an add-in of Excel, with the configuration of this specific tag,",

Our expected changedate value was only 7/22/2013 4:25:51 PM. What would cause the 'timeweighted' to appear?\n@Tim: I couldn't think of something different than a configuration change on that PI Point. Can you get the value of the changer attribute, this should tell you would made the change if different from the last time.\nIs the ptsecurity attribute is defined correctly to allow only administrators to change the configuration?\nPoints can belong to different Point classes and different point classes have different point attributes.\nTags that are serviced by the PI Totalizer subsystem are member of the \"Totalizer\" point class which has an attribute \"CalcMode\" that I believe is unique for \"Totalizer\" point class - at least with the default point classes.\nWhen retrieving the configuration of \"Totalizer\" tags using PI SMT add-in for Microsoft Excel, I see \"CalcMode\" on the left hand side besides \"changedate\" attribute.\nIs it possible the information within \"CalcMode\" has been merged into \"changedate\" within your application?\nBecause all point classes use the attributes from \"Base\" class plus additional ones, I suggest storing configuration data separated by point classes within your application - if this makes sense to you.\nWhat's the purpose of your application? Are you auditing the point table?\nIf you could please attach a spreadsheet generated using PI Tag Configurator, which is an add-in of Excel, with the configuration of this specific tag,", "decoded_offsets_from_start_true": [[0, 5], [5, 15], [15, 27], [27, 33], [33, 46], [46, 50], [50, 54], [54, 61], [61, 64], [64, 71], [71, 78], [78, 84], [84, 95], [95, 98], [98, 102], [102, 113], [113, 118], [118, 127], [127, 128], [128, 131], [131, 139], [139, 152], [152, 162], [162, 170], [170, 173], [173, 179], [179, 188], [188, 190], [190, 194], [194, 200], [200, 202], [202, 203], [203, 204], [204, 214], [214, 216], [216, 220], [220, 226], [226, 228], [228, 229], [229, 243], [243, 246], [246, 250], [250, 261], [261, 262], [262, 263], [263, 264], [264, 267], [267, 268], [268, 274], [274, 275], [275, 287], [287, 292], [292, 298], [298, 300], [300, 310], [310, 316], [316, 321], [321, 325], [325, 335], [335, 338], [338, 346], [346, 350], [350, 356], [356, 357], [357, 358], [358, 365], [365, 370], [370, 378], [378, 382], [382, 388], [388, 394], [394, 395], [395, 404], [404, 406], [406, 410], [410, 416], [416, 418], [418, 419], [419, 422], [422, 428], [428, 429], [429, 439], [439, 452], [452, 461], [461, 464], [464, 474], [474, 480], [480, 481], [481, 482], [482, 489], [489, 502], [502, 512], [512, 524], [524, 534], [534, 539], [539, 546], [546, 547], [547, 548], [548, 554], [554, 562], [562, 563], [563, 570], [570, 577], [577, 581], [581, 587], [587, 596], [596, 606], [606, 617], [617, 619], [619, 623], [623, 629], [629, 631], [631, 632], [632, 633], [633, 634], [634, 635], [635, 637], [637, 638], [638, 642], [642, 643], [643, 644], [644, 645], [645, 647], [647, 648], [648, 650], [650, 653], [653, 654], [654, 655], [655, 659], [659, 668], [668, 676], [676, 679], [679, 685], [685, 694], [694, 695], [695, 696], [696, 697], [697, 699], [699, 700], [700, 704], [704, 705], [705, 706], [706, 707], [707, 709], [709, 710], [710, 712], [712, 715], [715, 716], [716, 727], [727, 737], [737, 739], [739, 743], [743, 749], [749, 751], [751, 752], [752, 762], [762, 763], [763, 764], [764, 765], [765, 768], [768, 769], [769, 780], [780, 789], [789, 809], [809, 816], [816, 830], [830, 837], [837, 845], [845, 848], [848, 854], [854, 855], [855, 863], [863, 867], [867, 884], [884, 892], [892, 902], [902, 903], [903, 908], [908, 915], [915, 924], [924, 930], [930, 939], [939, 946], [946, 949], [949, 964], [964, 978], [978, 979], [979, 980], [980, 986], [986, 987], [987, 989], [989, 997], [997, 1007], [1007, 1018], [1018, 1028], [1028, 1037], [1037, 1042], [1042, 1057], [1057, 1071], [1071, 1085], [1085, 1086], [1086, 1087], [1087, 1093], [1093, 1097], [1097, 1107], [1107, 1117], [1117, 1123], [1123, 1135], [1135, 1145], [1145, 1151], [1151, 1159], [1159, 1174], [1174, 1180], [1180, 1191], [1191, 1192], [1192, 1193], [1193, 1196], [1196, 1206], [1206, 1218], [1218, 1222], [1222, 1225], [1225, 1231], [1231, 1235], [1235, 1245], [1245, 1249], [1249, 1263], [1263, 1265], [1265, 1270], [1270, 1274], [1274, 1275], [1275, 1281], [1281, 1287], [1287, 1297], [1297, 1310], [1310, 1312], [1312, 1316], [1316, 1320], [1320, 1321], [1321, 1326], [1326, 1336], [1336, 1346], [1346, 1350], [1350, 1352], [1352, 1357], [1357, 1361], [1361, 1362], [1362, 1368], [1368, 1374], [1374, 1376], [1376, 1385], [1385, 1390], [1390, 1402], [1402, 1408], [1408, 1416], [1416, 1417], [1417, 1418], [1418, 1422], [1422, 1433], [1433, 1437], [1437, 1454], [1454, 1456], [1456, 1461], [1461, 1465], [1465, 1466], [1466, 1471], [1471, 1477], [1477, 1480], [1480, 1484], [1484, 1491], [1491, 1495], [1495, 1511], [1511, 1512], [1512, 1518], [1518, 1520], [1520, 1524], [1524, 1528], [1528, 1529], [1529, 1551], [1551, 1559], [1559, 1561], [1561, 1567], [1567, 1571], [1571, 1572], [1572, 1582], [1582, 1583], [1583, 1584], [1584, 1598], [1598, 1614], [1614, 1621], [1621, 1623], [1623, 1627], [1627, 1631], [1631, 1632], [1632, 1641], [1641, 1653], [1653, 1655], [1655, 1661], [1661, 1665], [1665, 1666], [1666, 1673], [1673, 1690], [1690, 1691], [1691, 1692], [1692, 1699], [1699, 1703], [1703, 1709], [1709, 1717], [1717, 1725], [1725, 1736], [1736, 1741], [1741, 1743], [1743, 1747], [1747, 1748], [1748, 1754], [1754, 1759], [1759, 1770], [1770, 1775], [1775, 1776], [1776, 1786], [1786, 1794], [1794, 1808], [1808, 1813], [1813, 1826], [1826, 1832], [1832, 1840], [1840, 1847], [1847, 1864], [1864, 1866], [1866, 1874], [1874, 1886], [1886, 1893], [1893, 1894], [1894, 1895], [1895, 1901], [1901, 1916], [1916, 1933], [1933, 1934], [1934, 1942], [1942, 1951], [1951, 1961], [1961, 1967], [1967, 1968], [1968, 1969], [1969, 1981], [1981, 1988], [1988, 1995], [1995, 2009], [2009, 2019], [2019, 2025], [2025, 2028], [2028, 2032], [2032, 2033], [2033, 2045], [2045, 2046], [2046, 2058], [2058, 2065], [2065, 2068], [2068, 2074], [2074, 2075], [2075, 2084], [2084, 2101], [2101, 2115], [2115, 2119], [2119, 2120]]}

By using the same word, \u201cobey\u201d (vs. 9), as he did previously (vss. 4, 5, & 8), the psalmist establishes obedience as the central theme of this segment and links it to the previous one.\nA question of interpretation arises with the verb translated \u201ckeep pure\u201d (vs. 9 in the NIV). An earlier translation (KJV) renders this verb as \u201ccleanse.\u201d Was the author asking how a young man maintains his purity (NIV) or how he regains his purity after sinning (KJV)? While both senses may be conveyed by the Hebrew verb, the context pushes us in the direction of the NIV\u2019s interpretive translation (vss. 10 & 11). The psalmist first asks God to keep him from straying (vs. 10) and then gives the avoidance of sinful behavior as his motive for hiding God\u2019s Word in his heart (vs. 11). Three other words are repeated in this stanza: \u201cyour Word\u201d (vss. 9 & 16), \u201cpath/way\u201d (vss. 9 & 15), and \u201cheart\u201d (vss. 10 & 11).\nOnly those who delight in obeying God\u2019s Word maintain a lifestyle that honors him.\nWhat does hiding God\u2019s Word in our hearts (vs. 11) specifically entail? Believers over the centuries have considered this a strong exhortation to commit important scripture passages to memory. This way, verses needed at moments when we might be tempted to sin are readily available for our protection. Jesus modeled this for us at the beginning of his earthly ministry in his encounter with Satan in the wilderness (Mt. 4:1-11). In each of three temptations, Jesus responded by quoting verses from Deuteronomy. First, when tempted by Satan to turn stones into bread to assuage his hunger, he quoted Deuteronomy 8:3. (Mt. 4:3 & 4). Then when Satan suggested that he jump from the pinnacle of the temple to prove that he was God\u2019s Son, he quoted Deuteronomy 6:16 (Mt. 4:5-7).

By obeying your Word. (10) I seek you with my whole heart. Do not let me stray from your commands. (11) I have hidden your Word in my heart so that I might not sin against you. (12) Blessed are you, Yahweh! Teach me your decrees. (13) With my lips I rehearse all the judgments of your mouth. (14) In following the way of your statutes I rejoice as though (I were rejoicing) in great riches. (15) On your precepts I meditate, and consider your ways. (16) In your decrees I find delight. I will not forget your Word.\nThe first verse of the Beth stanza opens with a question, \u201cHow should a young man keep his life\u2019s path pure?\u201d The rest of the segment provides the answer. By using the same word, \u201cobey\u201d (vs. 9), as he did previously (vss. 4, 5, & 8), the psalmist establishes obedience as the central theme of this segment and links it to the previous one.\nA question of interpretation arises with the verb translated \u201ckeep pure\u201d (vs. 9 in the NIV). An earlier translation (KJV) renders this verb as \u201ccleanse.\u201d Was the author asking how a young man maintains his purity (NIV) or how he regains his purity after sinning (KJV)? While both senses may be conveyed by the Hebrew verb, the context pushes us in the direction of the NIV\u2019s interpretive translation (vss. 10 & 11). The psalmist first asks God to keep him from straying (vs. 10) and then gives the avoidance of sinful behavior as his motive for hiding God\u2019s Word in his heart (vs. 11). Three other words are repeated in this stanza: \u201cyour Word\u201d (vss. 9 & 16), \u201cpath/way\u201d (vss. 9 & 15), and \u201cheart\u201d (vss. 10 & 11).\nOnly those who delight in obeying God\u2019s Word maintain a lifestyle that honors him.\nWhat does hiding God\u2019s Word in our hearts (vs. 11) specifically entail? Believers over the centuries have considered this a strong exhortation to commit important scripture passages to memory. This way, verses needed at moments when we might be tempted to sin are readily available for our protection. Jesus modeled this for us at the beginning of his earthly ministry in his encounter with Satan in the wilderness (Mt. 4:1-11). In each of three temptations, Jesus responded by quoting verses from Deuteronomy. First, when tempted by Satan to turn stones into bread to assuage his hunger, he quoted Deuteronomy 8:3.

Additionally, OME does not exploit seriously injured and/or ill service members for fundraising purposes; i.e., a service member supported by OME will not be paraded across a TV screen and exploited for fundraising purposes.

The first term uses the projected value of x based only on previous information, as in the exponential filter. But instead of just taking the last filtered value, the best estimate of the trend is also added to account for the straight line assumption. The second term uses the correction for the newly-observed input at time k. The exponential filter factor a weights the past vs the new information.\nEquation 2 is an estimate of the trend, exponentially filtered with its own filter constant g. The first term uses the best estimate from past information, and the second term uses the correction for the most recently observed trend, y[k] - y[k-1] . The exponential filter factor g weights the past vs the new information.\nIf the input signal becomes a ramp (constant slope), then this filter output will track the ramp, approaching it asymptotically. If the slope of the ramp is changed, the filter output will again approach the new ramp. For that reason, this filter is competitive with a linear least squares filter, which also makes a straight line assumption. This is an IIR approximation of the FIR linear least squares filter.\nAlpha-beta filters are based on the same assumptions as double exponential smoothing. There are estimates of two variables, one the derivative of the other. The derivative is assumed constant for prediction. Upon receipt of new data, both the variable and its derivative estimates are updated. There are two parameters for the weighting of prediction vs correction: alpha and beta. It should have the same general characteristics as double exponential smoothing, although there may be no published comparison of this. See the Wikipedia article.\nOther signal models can be used. For instance, the predictions can include factors based on a sine wave. This is common practice in fields such as economics where seasonal adjustements are made. That is beyond the scope of this guide.\nA comb filter adds a delayed version of a signal to itself. This is used mainly in some specific electrical engineering cases where a signal at a particular known frequency is of interest.

The first term uses the projected value of x based only on previous information, as in the exponential filter. But instead of just taking the last filtered value, the best estimate of the trend is also added to account for the straight line assumption. The second term uses the correction for the newly-observed input at time k. The exponential filter factor a weights the past vs the new information.\nEquation 2 is an estimate of the trend, exponentially filtered with its own filter constant g. The first term uses the best estimate from past information, and the second term uses the correction for the most recently observed trend, y[k] - y[k-1] . The exponential filter factor g weights the past vs the new information.\nIf the input signal becomes a ramp (constant slope), then this filter output will track the ramp, approaching it asymptotically. If the slope of the ramp is changed, the filter output will again approach the new ramp. For that reason, this filter is competitive with a linear least squares filter, which also makes a straight line assumption. This is an IIR approximation of the FIR linear least squares filter.\nAlpha-beta filters are based on the same assumptions as double exponential smoothing. There are estimates of two variables, one the derivative of the other. The derivative is assumed constant for prediction. Upon receipt of new data, both the variable and its derivative estimates are updated. There are two parameters for the weighting of prediction vs correction: alpha and beta. It should have the same general characteristics as double exponential smoothing, although there may be no published comparison of this. See the Wikipedia article.\nOther signal models can be used. For instance, the predictions can include factors based on a sine wave. This is common practice in fields such as economics where seasonal adjustements are made. That is beyond the scope of this guide.\nA comb filter adds a delayed version of a signal to itself. This is used mainly in some specific electrical engineering cases where a signal at a particular known frequency is of interest. That is beyond the scope of this guide.\nRobust filtering attempts to reduce the impact of outliers.

experimentation in science and technology, the arts, commerce, politics, popular culture, everyday life, and the natural world.\nThe programme consisted of a range of workshops and arts events over the whole of the academic year, culminating in an international conference, The Experimental Society, on 7-9 July 2010.\nThe City Experiment is part of the FutureEverything 2010 festival (12-15 May) in Manchester \u2013 four days of astonishing artworks, an explosive city-wide music programme, visionary thinkers from around the world, and awards for outstanding innovations. During the central two days of the festival, The City Experiment will form a path by which participants can take in a number of festival events at the Contact Theatre and other venues across the city, including globally networked discussions, seminars, art events and film screenings. Go to the FutureEverything website for relevant conference and art events. Speakers will include Adam Greenfield, Maarten Hajer, Vikram Kaushal, Stephanie Koerner, Raymond Lucas, Simon Marvin, Francis McKee, Shawn Micallef, Saul Newman, Amanda Ravetz, Steven Smith, Sally Stone, Atreyee Sen, Erik Swyngedouw, Michelle Teran, John Worthington and Albena Yaneva.\nSecond call for papers and presentations for The Experimental Society - closes 12 March.\nThe second call for papers and presentations for the closing Experimentality Conference, The Experimental Condition (7-9 July 2010), is now open and will close on 12 March 2010. We encourage proposals for individual papers or for sessions of three papers, and proposals using various media from creative practitioners, researchers and postgraduates whose practice engages with the conference themes.\nA series of informal events around innovation, running from 16 to 18 February, have been organised around the visits to Lancaster University of Lucy Kimbell (Clark Fellow in Design Leadership at Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford), Daria Loi (Research scientist, Intel USA) and Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino (CEO and Co-Founder, Tinker.it!, London). For more information, click here.\nOn Thursday 15 and Friday 16 October, around fifty people gathered for the launch event of the Experimentality programme. Participants enjoyed twelve papers that explored the notion of experimentality in relation to a variety of domains, a performance of Ringside by the performance artist Mem Morrison, and a great deal of very lively discussion. The blog postings on the presentations and discussion from the workshop can now be viewed online.\nTo coincide with the launch event of Experimentality, we are launching this new, community website for the programme.

He didn't give up a run in the first, but he threw 25 pitches.\n\"Just reminded him he's going to have to be a little more economical,\" Gators coach Kevin O'Sullivan said.\nKowar struck out a career-high 13 in 6 2/3 shutout innings, mixing his changeup with a fastball still touching the mid-90s deep into his season-high 121-pitch performance that flummoxed Texas in a 6-1 win eliminating the Longhorns from the College World Series.\n\"It's probably the best I've seen him, to be honest with you, with the whole package, with everything concerned,\" O'Sullivan said. \"I thought he was really good last week with Auburn, too. He was really good against A&M during SEC play. But on this stage, I think this is about as good as he's pitched all year.\"\nThe Kansas City Royals' first-round draft pick struck out the side in the third and sixth innings and broke his previous high of 11 Ks he set against TCU in the CWS last year. He became the first pitcher in the CWS since UCLA teammates Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer in 2010 to record 13 strikeouts.\n\"Those guys are doing pretty well for themselves right now, so that's pretty cool company,\" Kowar said.\nHe's the first to strike out 13 at the CWS in fewer than seven innings in 40 years, according to ESPN.\nJonathan India, the No. 5 overall draft pick by the Cincinnati Reds and Southeastern Conference player of the year, singled to make it 1-0 in the first inning and he broke the game open with a three-run homer in the sixth.\nTexas starter Blair Henley (6-7) struggled with his control and lasted only 2 2/3 innings, the second-shortest of his 22 career starts. He gave up four hits, walked four and threw a wild pitch.\nFlorida (48-20) came into the game after a 6-3 loss to Texas Tech in its CWS opener. The Gators had committed 16 errors in their last 11 games and had batted .186 and scored a total of eight runs in their previous three games.\nThe Gators played error-free against the Longhorns, and their offense had 10 hits.\nKowar (10-5) didn't allow a base runner past second until the seventh. With runners on second and third, Kowar struck out Tate Shaw and Ryan Reynolds and then left to applause from both Florida and Texas fans.\n\"The first inning, the first three batters I didn't make really any quality pitches,\" Kowar said. \"Getting through that first was big, and then I was able to kind of get the fastball command working, and everything else played off of that the rest of the way.\"\nChase Shugart took over for Henley in the third and kept it a 1-0 game until there were two outs in the sixth. Nelson Maldonado's RBI single came before India's 21st home run of the season made it 5-0.\n\"Nelson, the whole year, he's a clutch hitter for us,\" India said. \"He rarely strikes out. He competes at the plate. That's what we needed. And he came through clutch for us. As they say, hitting is contagious. Just pass it on to me and I'll pass it on to the next.\"\nTexas (42-23) broke through for a run in the eighth on DJ Petrinsky's one-out single.\nThe Longhorns struck out a season-high 15 times against Kowar, Jordan Butler and Michael Byrne, the most for the program since fanning 17 times against TCU in 2017.\n\"People expected it to be a building year due to everybody we lost last year,\" Shugart said. \"But these guys proved everybody wrong and that's because of their attitude. The attitude we had was gritty. We weren't giving anything; we had to take it. We took the Big 12 championship and the regional and super regionals. We went out and competed every inning, every out, and that's what good teams do and I wouldn't trade this for the world.\"\nBig 12 player of the year Kody Clemens reached base twice against Florida and extended his hit streak to nine games, including multi-hit games five times. The son of seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens batted .419 (13 for 31) in the NCAA Tournament with five home runs, two doubles and 11 RBIs.\nFlorida plays another elimination game Thursday against the loser of Wednesday's game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. The Gators still need three wins to reach the best-of-three finals for the second year in a row.\nThe season is over for Texas, which lost 11-5 to Arkansas on Sunday and went winless in the CWS for only the fifth time in its record 36 appearances.", "timestamp": 1555741810000, "doc_text": "OMAHA, Neb. \u2014 Jackson Kowar's first inning didn't portend the stellar afternoon he was about to have Tuesday.

It\u2019s expected to open in two weeks at 43-29 Crescent Street, not far from Jackson Avenue.\nRockrose Development Corporation, the lot\u2019s owner, has come to an agreement with the New York City Food Truck Association, which has recruited a group of trucks interested in participating, said David Weber, president of the trade group.\nThey include Rickshaw Dumpling truck, the Treats Truck, Coolhaus ice cream sandwiches, the Milk Truck, Cupcake Stop, Eddie\u2019s Pizza, Frites \u2018N Meats and the Kimchi Taco Truck.\nInitially, Mr. Weber said, three or four trucks could gather at lunchtime in the lot, and more on the weekends, and for special events, the lot could ultimately accommodate 16 trucks, he said. At the start, 5,000 square feet of the 11,000-square-foot parking lot will be given over to food trucks; but the entire lot could be devoted to trucks if the location proves to be popular.\nFood-truck lots have long been a fixture in Austin, Tex., Portland, Ore., and greater Los Angeles, where the Southern California Food Vendors Association \u2014 which has 130 members \u2014 runs five food-truck lots. The New York City Parks Department has had several truck set up outside the former Tavern on the Green in Central Park since last year.\nIn Long Island City, the truck lot is near two CitiCorp buildings and a major Department of Health office, all rich with office workers, and , Ms. Dunphy said, Jet Blue and the new law school of the City University of New York are scheduled to open buildings nearby early next year.\nAlso, she said, a Dumpster pool, one of the 8-foot-wide, 22-foot-long mobile pools that have brought impromptu swimming to city neighborhoods in recent years, is scheduled to be installed across from the truck lot in August.\nThe association and Rockrose are still negotiating about who will be responsible for the ongoing operation of the lot, and about the rental or license fees that food trucks would pay to occupy the space.
